{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I ordered a 10 and a 12 because, depending on the brand, I'm almost always one of those two sizes. I could zip up the ten, and the tightness definitely looked hot on my body, but it resulted in some bulging through the side cutouts, so I went with the twelve, which was less form-fitting, but more comfortable for wearing at a wedding with a big meal and dancing. The fabric has a medium amount of stretch in it, so if it fits you more snugly, you'll still be able to move and sit down. I really liked this dress-- I liked the cut outs, of course, and also the way the neckline/sleeves were cut-- not cap sleeves, which I don't feel are that flattering for most women, but enough coverage on your shoulders and chest to keep it classy and keep you a little more protected when the temperature drops at night (the wedding was in San Diego and the October breeze coming off the Pacific was lovely but a little cold!).  Practical notes-- I didn't even try it with a bra, because I didn't want to have to be worrying about it showing through the cut outs all night, and used the Braza Reveal stickies to help keep my girls up in line with the darts built into the dress.

Here is my take:\n\nPros\nHigh quality fabric (black overlay on top of grey jersey like material) which makes it look expensive. \nThe length is great for shorter women (5'3\" and under) who want to show off their legs but is not too short. \nOverall, a nice design!\n\nCons\nFor those who are conscious of their mid-section (as I am), this dress may not work for you. It does seem to work for hourglass and straighter body types. \nThe slight shoulder pads made my shoulders look wider, which I did not want to accentuate, along with my larger arms.\n\nI truly appreciated receiving a dress credit from RTR and their customer service when the dress did not fit. Luckily, I was able to order an alternate dress on short notice through RTR, which I completely satisfied with! "}

It was not too comfortable when dancing, as the dress rode up a lot, but oh well! Loved the way it looked and had a great first experience renting a dress! Definitely recommend!"}

I did not wear heels with this dress so it was barely too long, I did trip a few times but not all night long.

I ordered a large (for reference, I am 5'2 155 with 34DD's, usually a size 8 in tops) and it was unwearable.  The XL was a bit roomy but looked very nice.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress was absolutely gorgeous. It is incredibly figure flattering and I got a million complements. One lady even said I was the most glamorous woman at the event! \nOn the model, the dress appears more silver/white but it is actually more of a gold/blush (which I think is apparent in my photo) in person.\nI ordered the 8R as the free backup to the size 10R I ordered.  I'm glad I did!  I honestly think I could have worn a 9 if they had it. The 8 was a little on the tight side, and I preferred the fit of the 10 in the body, although it was maybe a touch loose.  However, the 10 was too long.  I'm 5'4\" and wore 2.5\" heels and the dress drug on the ground, which is why I went with the 8 even though it was a bit tight. The 8 was the perfect length on me. \nThe dress is really low cut, as is obvious on the model. I pinned it up. Also, they say it can be worn with a regular bra, which is more or less true. If I hadn't pinned the front, my bra would have shown.  Also, I had to pin the back of the bra to my shapewear to keep it from showing in the back.\nThe dress came in way early (which was nice if it had ended up not working out.)\nMy one complaint is I wish Rent the Runway had the designer's sizing charts on their website. It's all well and good to reference the size you normally wear, but women's sizing is so wonky and varies so much from brand to brand, that that isn't a very helpful comparison. I have both a size 4 dress and a size 8 dress that both fit hanging in my closet right now.\nI had quite a few minutes of concern comparing myself to various reviewers and debating what size I should get before it occurred to me to google the designer and try to find the measurement/sizing chart. I ended up finding it on the Badgley Mischka site and using that to figure out my size, but it would awesome if Rent the Runway could have those right with each dress on this site.\nAll in all, I was very pleased with my experience and will definitely use Rent the Runway again!"}

Even though it fit fine (hostess at the restaurant liked it), I think it would be better on someone tall.  I did like the high waist, really flattering.  But I wasn't tall enough to really get the back zipper or sheer panels to stretch like they were intended so they could lay straight.  Plus, after about 10 minutes of having it on, the former wearer's body odor started to emanate from under the arms.  I had just showered and put on deodorant so not my smell.  Just a note for everyone to be sure to check your dress before you wear it.  I had tried it on, but not checked for odor.  By the time I knew about it, it was too late to get anything new.  For reference, I'm usually between a size 4 and 6, depending on the designer."}

I'm 5'5\" and wore the regular with 4.5\" wedges and didn't have any an issue with the length. The 4 fit great so I didn't even bother to try on the 2. When the dress arrived I noticed there was a rather large (about 2 inches) rip where the top layer of the flowy fabric was torn from the zipper. I assume this is from others who had issues with the length of the dress and stepped on it while walking. Additionally the zipper was really difficult so I needed help getting in and out of the dress, perhaps another reason why the fabric was ripped. I called a RTR stylist right away (always so helpful) and unfortunately they did not have other dresses in this size. The rip was not noticeable because of the flowy nature of the skirt so I wore it anyway without an issue. If you are on the fence about this rental, definitely order it! "}

I thought the dress was decent looking but was disappointed that it didn't have a true \"wow-factor\". For the $75 rental price, I think I got my money's worth but in no way did this feel like a $300+ dress. Perhaps be the dress has clearly been rented many times.

I am 5'6 and would have been much more comfortable in an 8, but not kidding, the 8R skimmed my calves. I have never worn a long in my life, so I guess this was a first! My heels were 3 inches and the L was perfect length. The material of the dress is very stretchy and forgiving-so perfect for a pregnant person. The slit is so high, I wish I would have safety pinned it down a little so I could have sat all night without covering my exposed thigh, but it is definitely what makes the dress feel so sexy. \nAlso, I have ordered from RTR before and this was my first negative experience. When asking for help with fit since I knew my size would be way different, all they said was \"check the bump friendly section.\" When my dresses came and I would have been most comfortable in an 8L, I contacted them and didn't feel I got a good enough response in order to feel confident that a new dress would come in time, considering you have to return your other dresses within 24 hours unworn.

The material has a little give, and the dress was so comfortable I didn't want to take it off!  It is really low cut, and I am blessed with a 34C bust, so I used a safety pin to keep it all together which worked perfectly.  It wasn't scratchy or uncomfortable in the least.  I will definitely wear this again!"}

{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "As you have probably seen in the reviews, it runs small. I was barely able to squeeze in but it was the only size left, so I took a risk. It worked out, but sitting for long periods of time and eating was uncomfortable. It's much better for walking around, standing. \nPros: \n-Classic dress, the style is great!\n-Quality materials. Sturdy zippers and hooks. Thick fabric hugs curves and hides (most) lines. Did not completely hide my boobs so I did wear a stick-on bra. Only showed the lines a little, not enough to distract from the dress overall.\n-Beautiful color, can be glammed up or paired with subtle sparkles for the Old Hollywood look.\n-Conservative in the front, sexy in the back.\n-Simple enough to go with any shoe, accessories, hair or make-up.\nCons:\n-Size may be an issue. Definitely know what cuts and styles compliment your body. My armpits had a little squeezing, but mostly when sitting. Same with my shoulders. I am pear shaped, and it complimented my shape, but there's no hiding your butt in this thing. It's tight, so if you need comfort, this would not be my first recommendation. \n-Revealing: Might be too risque, depends on venue and occasion. I was a little chilly walking to and from venue. Not a huge issue. It will show every single curve and bump or roll. Especially if you have to fit into your normal size (while they recommend ordering a size up). It's tight.\n-Was also a little disappointed that it did not come with the bow on the neck as shown in the pictures. I don't know if that's the person who had the dress before me's issues or RTR's issue. But it was lacking. \n-Length: I got a regular and it was still really long. Luckily, I had 5\" heels so the dress did not touch the ground. Might be a non-issue but depends what look you're going for. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "The dress is heavy and hot. That said, I loved that both wrists have zippers to ensure a slick, fitted look. The material is a bit rough but I think that goes hand-in-hand with sequins. I didn't have much movement to raise my arms - I can zip any dress I wear but this one, I needed help. Single ladies, make sure a friend or neighbor is around! I do love that I wore a sophisticated but fun dress that I never would wear if I had to commit to a purchase. the rental allowed me to explore my sparkly side and I would do it again. The blue flowers are on the back as well as the front. For such a glittery dress, I love that the blue blooms are a bit subtle in contrasting color and made this a memorable dress. Little give in the material but luckily this fit pretty perfectly. It may run even a tad bit, but for a chesty lady like myself, I didnt want to risk sizing down and I am very happy I didnt. Now that autumn is almost here, I would def. recommend this for a fall or winter wedding. (When I was in the sun, this was a bit too hot for september) Flattering cut and unique details made this a winner for me. "}

The size 10 was a little snug on my back and the size 12 was too big in the bust. I opted to wear the 10. Although the dress was a show stopper, it was highly uncomfortable to wear. Whatever tulle was used to \"poof\" the skirt was very rough and kept scratching my legs the entire night. Also because was dress was a little tight and the top is like a corset, I had bruises on my back when I took my dress off! Due to comfort and brusing  I had to deduct 1 star.  Still dress was 100% worth the trouble because it was so gorgeous! Whats beauty without a little pain? lol"}

The bride requested that the her kids and I (daughter in law), wear plum to coordinate loosely as bridesmaids.  This dress was perfect because it's true plum, not purple, and it has an interesting pattern.  The damask-type print on it is subtle, but very pretty -- I'm not sure if the background color is black or navy, but I ended up paring the dress with black suede heels and black tights for a streamlined look and it worked perfectly!  The cut of this dress is so special and exudes class - plus, pockets are just the best.  The V-neckline, as other reviewers note, would be lovely if it was an inch or two deeper, but I still wore a chunky, sparkly necklace, with plenty of room.

However, it's simply a stunning gown and I choose this one because it seems to be flattering to most figures (based on the photos from the other reviews). It has a mini-train that I LOVED and it makes a little \"swish\" sound when you walk. "}

I'm usually a comfortable 6, but needed to go up a size for the bust, so that it wasn't far too revealing (both of the ladies and just being able to see any bra you wore under it). The 8 fit comfortably in the chest, but was a bit larger around the waist. The color and contour of the dress was perfect, I got many compliments. I also loved that even with the cut outs, I could wear a regular bra. Always a plus!"}

It was like  2 inches longer than I wanted, but, I am very short so that doesn't apply to most regular sized people. It was unbelievably comfortable and the details were very nice.

It arrived with quite a few wrinkles and as you can see in the picture it ended up with more. I would only order this shirt if you own a steamer (which I do not). I put it in a steamy bathroom for 15 minutes and it didn't help at all, I also put it in the dryer with a damp cloth for another 15 minutes and the wrinkles were still there.\nThe shirt is absolutely beautiful, just not that practical. Sitting in my car also caused it to wrinkle so it's just a difficult piece. I wish that it had worked out a little better. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The dress fit me very well except for two areas: the rib cage and the length. The rib cage could have been a little more loose, but it wasn't entirely uncomfortable. The length could have been about an inch shorter but heels made up for this!

I could put my husband's entire wallet, and the fabric was weight down at all.    As other reviewers said, this dress is NOT silver but white.

I definitely could have worn it if it had been the only dress I ordered, but I went with the medium and it totally worked. The top fit 'better' on the small, but with the way that this dress is cut it still works if it is slightly looser. \n\nBottom line, I LOVED this dress. I seriously wish I could keep it.

The material is like a wetsuit, which is great because it hugs you everywhere and gives some extra support. In some photos it looked metallic, but it is not - the design is printed on. I wore it the \"correct\" way - with the V in the back - and was able to wear a bra without it showing. I rented both the small and medium and could have gone with either size - there was almost no difference between how they fit. However, since I was wearing it for a work function and the medium was just a tiny bit longer I went with it. I was glad I did once I started walking, because it does ride up. I was pulling it down all night, but I loved the dress so much I didn't care! A lot of people have paired it with a necklace, but I just did big sparkly earrings instead because there is so much going on with the dress already.

It feels somewhat like a bodycon and is great if you have a nice shape.  The thickness of the fabric and also the loose nature of the lower half keeps any lumps or bumps from showing and also keeps it SFW (safe for work? can that be a new acronym?).  The high neck detail is very pretty and would be great for when you need to wear your hair in a bun because the dry shampoo is no longer cutting it.   If it had been more than 10% off retail, I likely would have purchased.  I'll definitely rent again.   \n\nThe only con is that it doesn't photograph near as nicely as it looks in person."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "Pros - very comfortable and lovely design. Fit true to size if not a tiny bit big. Not tight.\nCons - backless but little to no ta ta support! And MUCH lower cut (at least on me) than it appears on the model. I usually don't mind that but...tried to hold the girls up with TWO different kinds of sticky bras (which I have used in the past with success) - both showed at the very top when I saw down (looked great when I was standing!) - I tried to move the bras as far down as possible while still providing coverage but no go so wound up going braless - which I hate. I AM short so may not be an issue for taller girls/longer torsos. \nAlso, seemed just a little stretched out through the shoulders/arms - not noticeable to the eye just felt very loose. Lovely dress, true to the pics. other than the cleavage!"}

The open back of the dress shows just the right amount of skin for a sexy but classy look. I'm 5'1\" and was wearing 3.5 inch nude pumps, but the dress was still a bit long for me. While the sleeves look great, they make it a little hard to lift your arms up, so beware if you're slow dancing with someone a lot taller than you! I went for an old Hollywood glamour look with soft waves, simple earrings, and a statement ring. With so much sparkle, it's hard not to feel like the center of attention in this dress!"}

This is actually the second time I've rented this dress, I also rented the same dress in the champagne color.  All around a solid choice!"}

The dress fit really well and the open back and bright color brought me many a compliment throughout the evening. I wore it to a wedding with an outside ceremony on a 90-degree July evening and I will say that it was pretty hot. Luckily, the open back provided ample breathability. I was able to dance all evening in this without any worries. I absolutely loved it!"}

My only 2 complaints would be that the length and tightness of the dress made it a little difficult to walk in.  The zipper goes all the way down in the back, so in theory I think I could've brought the zipper up at the bottom to create a little bit of a slit.  Also, I felt like I was constantly fixing the shoulder on the dress.  Otherwise a beautiful and sexy dress!"}

Spanx were a must, as well. The regular length was perfect for wearing comfortably short heals and later going barefoot on the dance floor. I definitely recommend a shawl or bolero jacket as the sequins under the arms did rub a bit."}

If you are on the taller side like me (5'7\" / 5'8\"), definitely get the long if you want to wear heels; the regular was too short for me.  The cut of this dress is so flattering to the waist and arms, it also makes you appear long and lean with the draping of the bottom of the dress.

The color is so pretty, the lace is very high quality. The lace overlay is delicate but sturdy enough so you don't feel like you're going to rip it. The bodice actually has boning in it, so there's some structure, hides any flaws without being constricting. I wore a strapless bra with it but probably not necessary for everyone. The fit is extremely flattering and modest enough for a wedding. The length was perfect (I'm almost 5'4\" with an athletic/pear shape). The overlay at the neckline is so gorgeous you don't even really need a necklace. I wore very simple onyx/diamond earrings and black patent peep toe heels. The dress speaks for itself and I found it didn't even need big jewelry.

{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress is everything! Being 4'11'' I was very concerned about renting a long dress because I'm very short. I've never had a long dress that I did not have to get several inches cut from the bottom. I read the reviews and there were other women who are on the shorter side (none as short as me) saying it runs short and they had to wear shorter heels than they normally do. Since the ruching is basically from just under the bust down to the knees, you can easily adjust the dress to be longer or shorter. Since the 40R fit me well, I would say length wise, it runs short. If you are average height or tall, I would definitely rent the L as a second size. As other reviews say, it is EXTREMELY tight, but it was a good thing. I did not feel like I was constantly adjusting my dress since it fit like a glove. The only part I would have preferred to be a little more loose was the bust area. Even though I'm short, I'm bustier than most women that are short. My girls were quite squished. The nice part is that the ruching hides most of your imperfections. I'm no stranger to cellulite but none of that showed at all. I cannot speak more highly of this dress. I plan on renting this dress again, I may even see if I can find it somewhere to buy it, that is how much I loved it. "}

Everything people are saying about this dress is true; hemline is on the conservative side, although I'm short and it hit me just fine. Sequins are scratchy, but that happens with all sequined dresses. The waistline is elastic and baggy; it's a dress that begs a belt, and with one it looks stunning. Overall, loved this dress and loved all the compliments I got on it even more. My coworkers are STILL talking about it!"}

The RTR site lists size EUR 40 as US 8, but I think it fits more equivalent to a US12."}

Great dress and decent quality."}

If you have a large bust, then I would go a size up. \n- I wear a size 6 in jeans and dresses, but the skirt will be a bit tight if you have wider hips or fuller legs\n"}

Running true to size,  I recommend sizing up for a fuller bust.   The arm holes are a more rigid shape which cuts into the bust area. While this adds a unique feature, we recommend wearing a thin strapless bra or a Nubra to avoid visible straps.  The fuller skirt makes this easy to wear and move around in.

The stitching on the skirt is eye catching and is what makes this so unique."}

{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "I loved this dress! I wore it for prom and it was unlike any other. The silver detail is made of a tinsel type material rather than sequins, so it looks classy while being glamorous and eye catching. The fit was extremely flattering for my butt. The train was a little longer than I expected, which got in the way of dancing, but nevertheless was beautiful. The one drawback to this dress was that the slip inside is extremely tight. I ordered the 0 and 2 and had to wear the 2 because the 0 was so constricting on my big butt and thighs, and still I could only take small steps. It was a hard decision between the two because the top was really big on my small chest with the 2 size, but it does have a corset type lining that helps tighten the top and I filled the rest out with a padded bra. I'm 5'0\" but wore 4-5 inch platform heels and the length was fine, just needed to be held up when I was walking.

It is a deep almost dark yellow color, not a bright yellow color, and the lace details are very nice. But the cut (and color) just wasn't flattering on me. From the waist down it flared out quite a bit to the sides and the dress material was rather stiff so this could not be prevented. I would recommend sizing down. I'm typically a size 6 (although that is more due to my hips and the hip area in this dress is VERY roomy), but only the size 4 fit me. The good thing about this is that a regular bra can be worn with it - the back is not nearly as low as it appears on the model in the RTR picture. "}

The dress was in perfect condition, clean, arrived on time and best of all was affordable and will not go to waste on one wear in my closet!!

I probably could have squeezed into a 2 if necessary as well, so I disagree about the dress running small (unless you are larger chested- then I can see it being restricting up top)."}

The dress was long, but I planned (and wore) 5 inch platform heels.  As you can see, it falls on the floor still.  The rest of the dress fit true to size.  When I first tried it on, I thought it was too small.  However, once I picked the right strapless bra, it was fine.  I did have a panic moment that I would need to get the next size up, but that would have been too big.  Customer service was willing to ship another one, for the additional overnight fee.  What drove me crazy all night was that the lining kept rolling up over my boobs.  You can see it in the third picture.  That was extremely annoying and distracting.  I had to constantly go to the restroom to pull down the lining and the sequence part up.  It was fruitless: it kept doing it.  I loved the style, the color, the sequence and the experience.  I will definitely rent again just for the convenience and style."}

If you are shorter than me or plan on wearing lower heels or flats, just be prepared the dress will drag a little. This dress was so comfortable, I was able to dance in it all night.

In hindsight, I'd have just taken the RTR stylist package for accessories. \nOVERALL: A previous renter called this dress a \"disco ball\" dress, and that's what sold me! :) It shimmered and sparkled!! It was still very elegant and the right balance of festive without being over the top! I had two strangers actually come up to me to compliment me on the dress - a first! - with one of them calling it a \"showstopper dress.\"  I had to mentioned RTR several times in recommendation! \n"}

The sequins will catch on things, so be aware of what you're near. You can't wear a regular bra with it, so I got one of the stick on bras that worked great. Also, if you're thinking of wearing spanx, keep in mind that the mesh panels on the sides come down all the way to your waist, so you have to be aware of where the top of your spanx are or risk showing the waistband. \nOverall a great dress and I'm so glad that I wore it!

This dress is a bit short, even on my smaller 5'5\" frame, but the occasion allowed for that.

I was a little skeptical at first, wondering if the dress would look right or if it would be more practical to buy one.  After several days, I couldn't stop thinking about this dress and knew that I had to give it a try.  I was really nervous about the fit and wasn't sure which sizes to order.  I am in between sizes and was worried that a larger size would fit my bottom half but swallow me up top, or that a smaller size would fit my small waist, but be too tight below.  I decided to go with the 4R, and the 2R as my backup.  I tried them on as soon as I received them and loved them both, but felt that the 2R was the perfect fit! Unfortunately, I noticed that the 2 had a hole in the leg where the sequins were missing.  I notified RTR about the damage, and they responded immediately.  I am so happy with their customer service, and am very impressed with their willingness to correct the situation without making a fuss! \n\nI ended up wearing the size 4 (which was still gorgeous on) and felt like a movie star all night long. I ran in to a bunch of old high school friends that I haven't seen in several years, and am so glad that I chose this dress, because it had everyone talking!  The dress was even more beautiful in person and hugged my body in all of the right places. It was figure flattering, glamorous and classy.  This dress was perfect for the wedding venue and November weather, but would warn anyone that this is a show stopping dress... If you're attending a wedding, be sure it's a black tie affair, because this dress runs the risk of showing up the bride!  I will absolutely use RTR again and have already recommended it to all of my co-workers!"}

I wore it out on the town with my lady friends and got tons of compliments. \n\nIt does pooch in the stomach if you're not standing up straight, since it's high-waisted.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I loved the dress and I felt terrific in it.  The dress is very elegant.  I felt it has a touch of sex appeal, and a lot of class.  It shows off your curves, so it fits the hourglass figures ladies well.  The material has just enough give in it to smooth out your figure's edges.  The gathering flattered my two-kiddo mid-section.  The bust has built in vertical wiring over each breast extending about 5\" to help hold up the dress and make your bust look flattering as well.  I wore the dress with a tight, strapless slip that had a built-in wired bra, but wouldn't have needed the bra necessarily.  The bust is also lined with an extra layer of stiffer material to help support your chest - great idea - and it doesn't show through the exterior layer of the dress at all.  \n\nI'm 5'3.5\" and the dress was pretty long on me.  I wore 4\" heels with the dress and it ended up being about the perfect length.  I had intended on wearing shorter heels that evening but had to upgrade to the 4\" based on the length of the dress.  \n\nI'm 35 yo and felt the this dress was perfect for my intended look - classy, elegant, with a splash of daring eye-catching qualities.  It was perfect for a black tie event, perhaps not perfect for a flashier, wild party formal event though (NYE, Mardi Gras, etc).  It's more subtle elegance, less flash and glamour.\n\nI did have a bit of trouble feeling like the dress was slipping down on my body throughout the night.  It's a heavier dress - the material is thick and there are a few layers of it.  But I don't think the dress needed adjustment any more than a usual strapless gown.  "}

The rental service was on time and the dress was in perfect condition, it was just too big on me. Would definitely try RTR again "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I read a TON of reviews on this dress before I decided on it. Here are a few things about the dress:\n1. It's not really true GOLD, it's more of a rose-goldish / with a tan/nude underlay so true gold shoes that I ordered online didn't quite match so I ended up with nude pumps which were perfect and matched the dress nicely. \n2. I felt a little like the dress made me feel bigger than I was on the bottom. I read some others wrote this too. I was afraid I looked pregnant all night. It's very lose and can be \"pillow-y\" in the stomach area, even if your stomach is flat but I guess it's good to hide flaws as well. \n3. The Zipper!! This is a big one. I read this on a few of the reviews and just figured, well I'll just deal with it IF it happens to be hard to zip. Well, boy was it!! I am not even exaggerating it was VERY hard to zip up and not because of size. Also, both of the dresses that I received had the problem. It is more than tricky. I did everything to get ready and prepared to just slip the dress on and go after my hair and makeup and then I panicked for almost 30 minutes that the dress wasn't zipping up, either size, and I would have nothing to wear. I tried everything. My husband tried, even my father tried. I took it off and tried, I put it on and tried, it was super hard to zip! It's like a section of the zipper is that way on both dresses and once you get passed that part (when your fingers are dented and sore) you will be fine :) just give it some extra time for the zippering I guess. \nI loved how it sparkled in the pictures and I felt comfortable in it, just wish the stomach part wasn't so poofy and the zipper got me very frustrated before walking out the door. \nGreat experience with the website and shipping, etc. though and I will use RTR again for sure!! I have recommended so many friends to this site from my photos on facebook. Lots of people never heard of this website and loved my dress. So I guess it was a success! "}

The fit was a little small, but I think with wear throughout the day it would stretch out.  The dress is very well made and very pretty.  However, it's not particularly flattering if you have a larger butt/wider hips.  The white part does not do anything for the hip area other than make them look wider.  I think that this dress would be beautiful on someone without much of a butt, but the design is not made for someone with a little more backside."}

{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "I am usually a size 10, especially on the bottom, but the size 10 was tight all around, so I'd say it runs small.

As others noted, it was hard to get up and down the stairs, as well as into the car because the dress is fitted at the bottom, and the length was just below my knee.   I didn't have trouble with the arms - maybe the larger sizes are more proportional since a lot of other people seemed to have that problem.  My arms are definitely not skinny.\nAs usual with my RTR picks, I received many compliments over the course of the night.

I have a very high waist and a pretty large rib cage, so I wasn't that surprised that the skirt was snug when it zips that high up.  Just something to consider if you have a similar body type.

I also wore a backless, strapless bra  and spanx. Spanx are a  definite must unless you have the perfect gym bod (I do not!) Some reviews said that gold would throw the dress off, but I accessorized with light gold and it was perfect (the bangles are the RTR Crystal Snake Eye Bangles-I wore the light ones). You will not regret this! This was my first order and it turned out amazing. Packaging and presentation was stellar and the cherry on top? The UPS delivery man was a hottie!! "}

The slip under the dress was a little small though, I have a large bust and big butt so I had to wear a different slip, which turned out to be the slip from my back up dress! I got so many compliments and I wish I could keep this dress forever!! Highly reccomend for any occasion! "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "My husband thought this dress was very flattering on.  It is fitted but definitely not too tight.  I usually wear a size 4 and could have probably ordered a 2 for a tight fit.  The material makes it easy to hide flaws.  The dress is not too low cut as I am very heavy chested and thought it showed an appropriate amount of cleavage for a formal event.  I would definitely rent it again."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I wore this dress just this past weekend for an October wedding--weather was cold, and dreary but damn was that dress pretty!  The color was perfect for the evening and I wasn't in the dark browns, or blacks that many of the other guests were in.  The dress got tons of complements!\n\nA few interesting aspects however:  the lining and filler of the skirt which is a nude color is loner than the hemline of the dress--not so much that anyone seemed to notice but odd.  The chest was a little tight for me but I do have a full bust (36DD actually).  This dress has been danced in so there was some wear on the sleeves but that didn't detract from the experience.  The length was not as short as the model in the picture which I found to be a bonus."}

It runs true to size, maybe slightly larger (usually I'm a 6 or 8, and the 6 was a smidge too big) My only complaint was that it was a little short - the dress just barely grazed the top of my 3 inch boots. This was fine for my costume, but I usually wear 4-5 inch heels and it definitely would have been too short with heels that high. Overall I would highly recommend this dress and rent again!"}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "I ordered this weeks in advance for a wedding.  When it arrived, I noticed the inner white lining was hanging further down than the outer fabric.  I tried it on, and indeed the lining was long both at the front and back side.  Despite the customer service rep's efforts for over an hour while i was on the road to find replacement dresses, I had to wear this because the substitute dresses did not fit right and all the other choices were unavailable.  I must thank Kelly still for all her help and effort.  \n\nWith that said, I still received MANY compliments on this dress.  Someone even said my dress was the best that night.  I had to wear 4 1/2 inch heels so that the dress would go just about to the ground.  The chest area was very roomy and the cut is very deep.  I safety pinned it, and because it was double layered and had draping, it was impossible to see the pin.  The cut of this dress is VERY flattering, and you can EAT without any consequences on the day of your event because the bottom half is very flowy.  (So you won't notice the food/drinks bulge.)  This dress is very comfortable to dance the night away, but be sure to hold it up when going up stairs.  The colors and print move so beautifully and the dress truly made me feel gorgeous. \n\nHowever, I can't give it a full 5 stars, because I did have to use MANY MANY pins to \"hem\" the inner lining, as well as LOTS of fashion tape to fix it in the front and back.

I could have worn the 4, but it was just tight enough to make it uncomfortable to dance in.  As for the style, it was classic and pretty perfect.  I'm close to 5'9, so the regular length just grazed the floor when I was standing flat-footed, and with a 1 or 2 inch heel, it picked it up enough that I or anyone else wouldn't trip on the dress.  The material is stretchy and forgiving and if you're small busted like me, it is very easy to get away with no bra.  Overall, I don't think I could have worn something more perfect to an old hollywood prom in a downtown old hollywood space.  It was classic and RTR is efficient and fabulous for formal dresses.  So happy with my decision to use them again!   "}

I am short (5'0\") so I got the petite size and wore 4, maybe 5 inch heels under this dress.  Even then, it swept the floor a bit, but it did not bother me at all.  The dress hugged and accentuated my waist perfectly, but I can see why other women are noting that the chest area is tight.  I am an A cup so it did not bother me whatsoever, but I can definitely see the why the chest would be pretty tight with bustier women.  I felt completely comfortable in it, the fabric was light, the dress swayed perfectly when I walked, and the color definitely popped out.  "}

The dress is a beautiful color, but like other reviews mention, the shoulder detailing is definitely more ivory/white than gold. It's still beautiful.

If you get it, plan on it being long if you're average height; I don't know how someone very short would be able to make it work.

I wore it to a 100th birthday gala  for a vendor my fianc\u00e9 works with at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and it fit the event and venue so well. I wore the dress with flats and it was the PERFECT length, it just skimmed the floor, but I didn't trip over it or worry about others stepping on it. And being able to wear it with flats also meant I wasn't one of the many women I'd seen at the event who had taken their heels off by the end of the night. The material was heavy, but had some stretch and didn't get too warm, and the dress does have a liner. I wore a sticky bra (as it is backless), and a pair of slip shorts for my foundation layer. Everything laid so nicely and I felt amazing, and again so comfortable all night. LOVE it!! "}

It was the perfect length and hit mid-calves; tea length. Amazing to move around in, hangs loose around hips and anything below the rib cage and twirls like a million dollar gown. This dress is ideal for those gifted with a fantastic bosom (of which I do not have). There are cups sewn into the dress which is nice, and there's some wire to make sure the top stays flush to your skin. Definitely a dress guaranteed to make you feel like a goddess - and a testament to, \"If you've got it, flaunt it!\" Ultimately, I ended up going with a more form fitting dress, but this would be a dream for the right body type."}

This dress knocked it out of the park - elegant and conservative enough for an older crowd, but the dramatic ruffle detail added interest. I could probably have sized down - while the dress stayed up and in place with the addition of a small amount of fashion tape, it was a bit roomy throughout the body and the zipper accordingly crinkled a bit - I think it may have been stretched out over time. Also might have benefited from the long - my dress grazed the floor in back and skimmed the top of my toes in the front. Thank goodness the shoes were cute :) "}

It felt like the back of a patch feels which I thought was so odd for such a high end dress.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I have gained weight so nothing in my closet fit and I needed a floor-length dress.  I was hesitant to rent a dress I had not tried on, so I finally figured out that I could go to the new RTR shop near my home in San Francisco which had been open just one month. This was the first dress I tried on, it was perfect. I tried on other dresses I had seen  on line, but this one was the best by far. It fit, it felt great, it was the right length, it was a nice price. I love the lace, the dress is elegant and classic, but not frumpy. I wore 1.5 inch heels and the dress dragged ever so slightly. \nI tried it on with the \"sleeves\" tucked under my arms and did not realize this was incorrect until I saw the dress online later. I ultimately wore the sleeves the way they were intended, but wearing the sleeves under your arms is a fun and attractive option, it gives a fun ruffle around the shoulders. My event was conservative, so I wore a tea-length black slip underneath to bring the underlay farther down. One could also wear sheer black hosiery which would also make the look more subdued. \nWhen you investigate going to a RTR shop you are steered toward making an appointment to pay to be \u2018styled.\u2019 However, you can go in and try things on without an appointment. The only downside is there is the possibility that the dressing rooms will be full with those who have appointments. If you are an experienced shopper who knows what you like you do not need an appointment, just try to go when it\u2019s not busy. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I am obsessed with this top! It has such a fun and stunning color! It also has a very unique shape. I love how it differs from the traditional short sleeve silky shirt. The sleeves highlight the shoulder which is great if you don\u2019t have wide shoulders. They also have a double layer detail that make it super appealing and flowy. The collar and buttons are great and the knot in the bottom gives the shirt its charm! It is super feminine and perfect for the summer! It has a super lightweight material that does not wrinkle! Pair it with white, black or denim shorts or pants and you will rock your OOTD!"}

Only minor thing was the material underneath the arms was a bit loose, but a little fashion tape kept them in place and I never thought about it again. The dress is a bit fitted through the mid-section, but very flattering. Highly recommend! "}

The 0 ended up fitting perfectly (especially since I didn't have a backless bra to wear for support)!

The dress was also somewhat shopworn, with one of the spring-steel bones poking through the inside of the lining (I covered it with painter's tape so it wouldn't scratch me). From the pictures, I thought the pattern was woven into the fabric, but it turns out it's just a print. This dress just wasn't my style - I rented it because it seemed like a dress the bride would like, and she did. I really didn't like it, but that was my own fault for picking something so different from my usual style. It was comfortable, and had great, convenient pockets, and the back is neat. Just beware the inside boning and be aware you can't wear a bra with it."}

I didn't need to wear a bra- the material is thick and holds you in.  the color is beautiful and great for weddings- not too light as to look white- I was worried about that, but it wasn't anywhere close.  being on the taller side, the length was perfect as well.

I put a 1 inch closure using a very fine needle and thread to close the gap in the front, and after my event I unsewed it.  It was a temporary fix for sure.  I wore the Victoria Secrets U-plunge Backless Push-Up Bra.  Does not much for a \"push up\" but helps kinda hold things in place.  That was the best I could do, for a DDD kinda bust, going bra-less was not an option. "}

Also, great if you have a booty!\nGood for dancing comfortably.

I enjoyed this dress to say the least. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress is so comfortable! The sleeves+length were perfect for our Southern town's outdoor, late-spring  event.  Beautifully made, the lining is nice & heavy.  Only complaint would be that the lining in the sleeves can slip down below the lace, but the pockets more than make up for that.  I had my phone & lipgloss in one pocket with ID in the other.  I'm uncomfortable with my upper arms right now, so the style was nice.\nDeep purple is a little dark for spring/summer, but here I am in the spring & it was a great pick.  I ordered the 10 & the 8, but the 10 was a perfect fit. Consider going up for your extra size."}

The tight part hit right above my bump, which meant I was able to wear my normal size so the straps/top fit perfectly.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 3, "review": "I love the back of this dress - hence why I rented it in the first place. The skirt was also flattering, and nice for a party where I was drinking and eating a lot. However, I hated the front. The bust area was just awkward. There is a vertical seam that looks out of place and pointless, and there isn't any sort of padding or lining to really shield the girls. Since this dress cannot be worn with a regular bra, I was hoping for a little more support in the chest. I'm a C cup, and the size 6 chest was loose on me. I tried on the 4, and the back was too small, but the chest was STILL too loose. What gives? Keep this in mind if you are small chested. \n\nThis is a pretty dress overall, but if you rent it, definitely practice your \"back to the camera\" or over the shoulder pose. Clearly I didn't quite get it down that night. "}

The dress is not see through but I still wore nude color under garments. The back of the dress looks beautiful which is why I wore my hair to the side so I can show it off. You can still wear a bra but I used a strapless bra that allowed me to lower the back strap so you cant see it.  I accessorized with a light pink bracelet and earings and wore loght pink pumps.I love this dress it's Beautiful! "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Size 4 fit comfortably and was the perfect length.

The dress was all I hoped for coming out of the garment bag- vibrant color, great detail on the lace overall, and especially on the edges, and a soft, comfortable feel. But it was not suited for my petite frame. The length was not problematic- it was below my knees, but in an elegant way. It was the bust area that was troublesome. The lining was perilously close to exposing me. Unless I constantly tugged the dress up, my bra could become visible. There was just too much space between the lace neckline and lining for my size. Also, the dress gaped/bunched a bit in the back due to excess fabric and me adjusting to cover my bra. \nWas it wearable? Yes, with a nude colored bra. Did anyone notice these issues other than me? Probably not, unless they were looking for the problem. But would I have purchased a dress that fit like this? Never. \nPetite renters beware."}

But, I just loved it so much I went for it anyway!  I wore 3.5 inch heels and was able to walk around.  I think if I had been dancing at the event, I would have definitely tripped but it worked.  It was very comfortable and in great shape.  The color is really a beautiful blue and I like the material.

It was not super tight at the waist, so it was easy to sit without worrying about our natural skin \"rolls\".  I wasn't constantly pulling it down or shifting it; with that said, it was not skin fitting, tight, the highlight of the dress is definitely the sleeves and shoulders.  Note: I wore it to an team event; I wanted RED, but this is more ORANGEY-RED; vibrant color, but NOT RED."}

Both dresses fit, but I felt that the tighter fit of the size 4 kept everything sucked in better than the larger size! The dress was comfortable to sit in and dance in, and the material had enough stretch that I could eat without feeling like I was going to pop the zipper. The dress did show some slight wear and tear - the boning in the cups was poking through the material and the hem was ripped when I got it; I emailed RTR and they are addressing the issue. My only complaint about the dress is that I should have ordered the Long - at 5'7, the Regular was barely long enough when I was standing barefoot. Overall, it is a beautiful dress - and so popular that another woman at the 60-person wedding was wearing the exact same dress!"}

Im also short (5'4) and the length of the regular with 3 inch heels was exactly where it needed to be.\n\nThe material is also a great weight and doesn't wrinkle easily so the dress looked great all night.

I have reliably been wearing other Marni dresses in 46 (and a couple of 44s) and I could have easily fit in a 42 in this model - I had nearly 2\" extra on each side at the bust.

Love the way the skirt stands out from the body and I would definitely recommend wearing a big statement necklace.

I also didn't have to wear a bra due to the thickness of the material! Speaking of thickness- no lines show of anything which is nice.

To help with the debate from other wearers:The bottom of the dress is a champagne color. It's not gold and it's not a silver.

The lace and the dress length mean you don't have to wear hose. This dress is very adaptable and could be accessorized to work with the tone of the event or time of day - though the dress itself has so much going on that it doesn't need much accessorizing. It's also very comfortable to wear for hours, dance in, sit in, etc. \nKeep in mind:\nUnless you're a contortionist, it's not possible to zip up the back yourself. I ran around the halls of the hotel until I found a friendly maid who laughed and then zipped me up the rest of the way. Same goes for unzipping late at night when you've returned exhausted from the event. Just something to keep in mind if you're attending solo!\nAlso, bra straps. If you're wearing a regular bra, wear something lacy and navy blue, because the straps will show at some point.

If I did it again, I would have worn it with a different crop top rather than a full top. People STILL came up to me telling me they loved the skirt though.

I ordered an 8 \u2013 my backup size was not available. I typically wear anything between 6-10 and the 8 was a little big so I definitely could have worn a 6.

The stretch allowed me to enjoy the food and drinks at my friend's wedding, and to dance as well. \nI am small-chested, and I had cleavage for the first time...so it is fairly tight in the bust. The 4L fit my body well, but was too short, even in flats. The 6L was perfect, and not that much larger in the overall fit, but longer."}

It is extremely flowy (and perhaps a little large) & forgiving (which I like since I don't want to feel like I need to suck in the whole night).  The color is bright and cheery.  It came delivered freshly pleated & even though I folded the dress in transit to the wedding, it never wrinkled or lost its crisp pleats.  Material is a little bit shear, so I would not recommend wearing darker undergarments.  I wish I didn't have to return it!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This is a beautiful dress! The fabric is a richly re-embroidered lace and reads a deep red. It is lined across the bust and from the waist to the hem. The hint of skin was appropriately sexy for the occasion (family wedding) and my age (58). I wore a strapless bra to give me some shape but it could easily be worn without a bra. It fit me perfectly- skimmed over the body. The hem hit just below my knee cap (I am 5'5\"). The slit in the back made walking easily but climbing into my sister's SUV required a bit of finesse. I deducted a star because the lining in the front drooped a good 1-1.5\" below the dress. I had to temporarily hem it so it wouldn't show. I love this dress and would definitely rent it again. "}

It worked well with all three, most notably with white jeans as you could see the angled details of the hem the best. The top is definitely unique and I loved the little hidden pocket at the front. It;s a nice combo of off-the shoulder and open-blouson sleeve. I'd definitely rent again!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This was an Unlimited order for me, and I almost returned it immediately, since a previous renter had ripped out the inseam on one of the legs.  The shorts ARE super short (as you can see from my partially exposed thigh tattoo in the pic), so presumably she was trying to get some extra length, but who does that?  Anyway, I decided to repair with fashion tape and wear it around for a day.  People went nuts over this thing!  The top part is structured just enough to show that you have a waist and is true to size (or maybe a tiny bit big).  I'm 6'0, so this can work for tall girls if you're okay with showing some skin on the bottom half.  The material is thinner than you might expect.  I get so many compliments every time I wear it that I ended up buying it, despite my frustration with the torn inseam.  This will be a wardrobe fixture through autumn.   "}

I am considering a political candidacy in the near future so I attend many business to cocktail to black tie events so RTR is my go to! This dress was rented out for backup sizes so I was left with only an option for the size 12. What I have found with Diane Von Furstenburg is that you have to go up a size if you are busty or have a large backside. I have both so although I usually wear a 10/12 when I order her dresses I always order the 12 with the 14 as a backup. This one zipped fine and everyone loved it but since my chest and backside filled out the dress, it was shorter than I would have liked. Otherwise, beautiful dress with beautiful detail!"}

Similar length/fit as on the model. I love that it shoes some leg and shoulders but is still totally classy. \n\nQuality wise, it would be nice if people who wore this dress realized that, NO, you cannot lift your arms about 45-90 degrees or reach too far forward. The was a tear at the top right near the \"sleeve.\" I wish it weren't there but in all black it really wasn't noticeable. My other complaint was that due to all the laundering and folding the structured hemline was not very smooth, again it's passable but not picture perfect. Lastly, i would agree, the boning is pokey, but again, it was fine for one night. "}

It was perfect for a \"black tie optional\" event where many people dress down- the hi-lo hem make it very transitional. Fabric is amazing- thick and beautiful. Do NOT underestimate the reviews saying to go up a size or two- there is no give to the fabric and it is tight.  I'm a solid 6 in dresses but would have been more comfortable in a 10 I think. The 8 worked but it was a tight squeeze. I'm 34DDD-29-39 for reference. No bra needed- the girls are up and out.

The fit was tight around my ribs - Im a true zero and had trouble zipping up - but I don't know that a size bigger would have done it as the straps and the neck were starting to bow/buckle - so a large size would have not fit well. Im a 32C so maybe a smaller bust it would look better - it is beautiful but be prepared to have a back up just in case. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I really loved this dress.  The color was gorgeous - very vibrant.  I only don't give it five stars because there was an issue with the hem... it probably just needed a good pressing, but the hem of the slip wasn't folded under correctly, and kept falling down lower than the lace layer.  But other than that, the dress was great - the open back was fun and, again, the color is amazing!  There's really no stretch in the fabric."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The fit was great. Form-fitting at the waist, and very flattering. I will say, as a shorter girl, heels are necessary to get the benefit of the proportions of this dress. Since it is below the knee, heels just give you that length that petite girls need. Then you can strut your stuff like you just came off the set of Suits."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Love this cute but casual look!! It's great for any cup size due to comfortable room at the bust.

The dress is kind of short, so be prepared for that as well. "}

It came up to mid-thigh and I made sure that my booty wasn't sticking out too much (I also have a bubble butt, so there is hope for the smaller bottomed maidens!). I paired with patterned tights and knee boots--LOVED it! I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the seam along the bottom/skirt kept folding upwards. Otherwise, it was well made and comfortable. I think it was definitely on the edge of what could be deemed \"work appropriate\" for me, but I thought it was quite fashion-forward for my workplace.

I'm 5'4\" so things aren't usually short on me but I didn't want to take a chance. I had to wear 4.5\" heels and the dress was still about 1/2\" too long, though manageable. This dress was a little big on me in the midsection and made me look a little thicker than I actually am. But it didn't look too big thanks to the ruching. The fabric is stretchy and I could've gone down a size or two and still been ok. I am very busty (38DDD+) and there was plenty of room and coverage for the girls. Recruit some help for the zipper, you will need it even if the dress is a little big. The dress was beautiful and very comfortable.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Immediately fell in love with this dress! I loved how light the fabric was, but it still felt formal enough to wear to a summer work event or an elegant dinner. It runs true to size, and I suggest going up one size as your backup since the bust is a bit fitted and the fabric has no stretch.  I also recommend this dress to A to C cup sizes. The pleasant surprise to this dress are the side cut outs under the arms. They are small but add an edgy element to the dress.  I would pair this dress with black sandals for an afternoon out and dress it up with pumps, bangles and red lipstick for a dinner date."}

RTR was fabulous and let me rent this dress (which was more expensive than my original dress) and overnighted it to me to get here on time. I ordered both the 6 and the 8, and decided to go with the 8 since it fit my hips better. While it's tight fitting, the fabric is super comfortable and light. Even though I am not large chested and was worried with the open back it would be too big, it fit fine. Loved the dress and wish it was in my closet! After this experience, I would be happy to rent from RTR again with the great customer service I have received. They've been seriously incredible!"}

That was a little frustrating since my feet were definitely feeling the pain of dancing within a couple hours.  \nOtherwise, the bodice is very well-fitted, yet still very comfortable to wear. I don't think I could have found a dress to better accentuate my shape. I would definitely recommend this dress, especially to someone a few inches taller."}

This is the only Elizabeth and James dress I have ever worn that I would say you can actually get away with your true size instead of having to size like with all the others in this brand.

I note that some women are wearing the straps a bit differently but for myself, this was the best and most comfortable.  I wore an invisible adhesive bra underneath and that was perfect!

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The dress ran true to size for me, but I am small chested and there was not much extra room. \n\nThe zipper is difficult to get past where the skirt meets the bodice, so this is not a dress you can put on by yourself. I found it helpful to \"cinch\" my waist with my hands while my partner zipped the dress up to relieve tension on the fabric. \n\nThe dress is very king and I think designed to trail on the floor. I wanted to dance without worrying about stepping on it, so I had to wear 3\" heels to make it barely skim the ground in the back. Anyone under 5'6\"-5'7\" should consider getting the petite size, otherwise you will have to wear very tall heels or have it drag the ground. This dress may not work for people under 5'3\" without touching the ground in the back. \n\nThe fabric is warm, so not a great choice for an outdoor event in warm weather despite it looking a bit floral.

Great choice if you want to be on trend without out be too trendy."}

After trying a few pieces on, I ended up choosing the Badgley Mischka Sequin Garden Dress and it was a great fit.

I was hoping it would look more coral based on the pictures I saw on here.  It photographs very differently depending on the lighting.  The lining is beige and the lace is red red.  \n\nFIT: When I first received the rental I was worried the dress would be far too short for me, I am 5'7/5'8ish.  There is no wiggle room, the fabric is not stretchy at all.  However, I felt the style of the dress was pretty flattering on my body type (pear shape), and likely most body types.  It accentuated the smallest part of my waist and flared out a bit at the hip so it was slightly forgiving in that area.  I ended up feeling pretty comfortable in it despite the length.. even while toting around my toddler.  \n\nCONS: The lace definitely appears worn up close.  Having the dress arrive wrinkled was also disappointing.    \n\nOVERALL: I felt this was totally worth it...  I ended up wearing a much nicer dress than I could have purchased in that price range.  I would definitely, definitely rent from RTR again.\n  "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 3, "review": "It was definitely long enough for my height and wearing heels - definitely can't wear with short shoes. I thought it fit pretty well on the bottom but thought it could have been a bit more fitting up top. The major con I thought it had was that it shows EVERY detail of your stomach and hips which are my biggest flaws. It has an additional section of fabric that runs over the mid section and accentuates the stomach and hips. I wish the back dropped even a bit more to show a bit more skin. The other thing that bothered me was the string to hang it creep up the dress and start to poke out of the cut out on your waist so had to be mindful of that, especially when dancing around. It moves really well though and is comfy."}

I was worried because the dress was only available on the day of my event, but it came the day before which was perfect.

Even family members who are not always the most forthcoming with compliments, told me how great I looked. \n\nAs far as the fit, I think it's true to size, perhaps a tiny bit 'forgiving.' I normally wear a 6/8/M and 34/36D. I'm an hourglass, however I have very large arms and was concerned the M size might not fit me in that area, so I ordered a L size as a backup. I didn't even take the L out of the bag because the M fit perfectly -- like a glove, not a sausage casing. \n\nThe one drawback was that the sequins caught on themselves a few times. There was one moment where my wrist was connected to my hip on a sequin, which made for a funny moment on the dance floor. No big deal, but it happened a handful of times. Also the dress is really short when you sit down, so keep that in mind, too.\n\nI feel like my approach to dressing for special occasions is forever changed because of RTR. It was such a great experience, I would recommend RTR and this dress to anyone who wants to shine :)"}

The dress is great quality and didn't itch like a lot of other sequin gowns! I did have a twin at the concert though! We both rented haha! I got the 10, but was too tight in the rib cage. I would recommend! It an attention grabber! "}

It's a cute, well-made dress (Joie is always great). Unfortunately, I am short-wasted, so the dress hit me at a spot that made the top look too baggy. I probably could have sized down to avoid this, though I think the dress really does run true to size (I'm a size 8, medium and ordered a medium in this dress).

It's a well-made, structured cocktail dress.  I ordered a 2 and a 4 and went with the 4 for a \"roomier\" fit.  I typically wear a 4 in dresses because of my chest size.

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "Based on reviews, I got a European size 8 (5'3 124 lbs).  With the belt, this jacket came down to almost mid-thigh on my height--which I found even more flattering than the way it fits on the model.  The jacket is cut a bit like a kimono, but by sizing down, and cinching the belt tight, it looked more fitted on my short frame.  The fabric is unique and the print is even more unique.  Just so charming and hip at the same time.  A few notes: if you haven't already discovered, RTR places belts in small black bags found in an inside pocket of the shipping bag.  Don't overlook it because the belt is key.  Also, the belt has a compatible print to the jacket which makes for a very upscale custom tailored look.  I wore it with black jeans and short boots going out for dinner one night, and over a grey cashmere sweater with raw hem denim jeans to an outdoor evening pizza party in California in December.  The jacket doesn't have a lot of weight, but the fabric and texture were warm enough over a sweater in chilly weather that I was quite comfortable in 55-60 degrees.  It doesn't have a warm lining so not advisable for really cold nights.  "}

{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "First let me say why it was so nearly a full 5 stars! Wore this for a formal work function and of the other ladies in our group, there were at least 3 RTR dresses! Unfortunately, this is the only the fabric was super comfy; a little thicker, with a little stretch without feeling like you're pulling on your fav yoga pants, heavy enough so it fell beautifully and was really fun to swirl around in, but not so heavy like your blackout curtains, a nice V in the front, but not toooo much (I'm pretty busty at 34DDD and felt perfectly comfortable without a bra and fabric tape for backup!).  \n\nNow, the two reasons I can't give this a full 5 stars: first, even though I rented both my real size and backup size in Long, it looked like I might have received the 'regular' length and was on the short side. The tags on the inside of the dress weren't clear either way, so I had to assume I received the 'longs' as I ordered.  I had to wear very short heels with the dress and, as you can maybe see in the picture, it still didn't have the little train in the back (which I was really looking forward to!) Second, it did seem to run small. I could have squeezed into the 8, but it would have been much too tight.   I loved wearing this dress and, if it weren't for the two issues above, would have put it in my \"keep it forever\" faves for future purchase"}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "While I loved the look of the dress standing straight up, if I bent over or moved around at all the fit started to get a little unflattering.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I picked this dress out at the RTR showroom in NYC, so I knew I loved it. Great for covering full hips and accentuating waist. The bust seam hit higher than it should have on my body, but it wasn't obvious... just caused a flatter look than I normally like. Also, it's a little longer than in the model's pic. Was disappointed in some fraying in the metallic fabric when I originally received it, but that wasn't anything that a quick trim didn't fix.   Overall, I would definitely rent this dress again."}

I actually witnessed one of them doing a double take at me. I will admit, I felt like it was a little too tight, so if you are self-conscious or uncomfortable with wearing something tight, size up at least a size, if not 2. I probably would have been slightly more comfortable with a 10 instead of the 8, but my husband said it looked amazingly hot (it pushed my boobs up so well - no bra was needed- though I wouldn't have had room to wear one even if I wanted to). Because it was a little snug and because of the way the hem is designed, it did ride up a bit and comes up pretty high when you sit, so also definitely size up if you feel like that's going to be a problem.

Honestly, there wasn't much of a difference that I could tell. The length on both allowed me to wear 3.5-4 inch heels and the dress did not drag. The hem fell in the right spot.

It's forgiving around the middle making it a perfect dress for not worrying about what you eat/drink all night. I wore it in July, but the fabric would be appropriate in winter too. It's definitely a blush/rose gold per the other reviews. Super pretty!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I never wear evening gowns and felt super fancy in this. Was a little worried this gown might be too long, but it just grazed the floor (I wore 3-inch heels). Only trouble was the back, which was too big. I have a small frame, and the hook and eye closures between the shoulders would not hold, since they weren't pulled tight enough. I was able to layer one side over the other and have a friend secure them with safety pins. And I wore my hair down, so I don't think anyone noticed. Didn't wear a necklace but did borrow sapphire/diamond drop earrings, which were perfect."}

I struggled to even take a selfie in it LOL. Sizing up definitely makes the waist bulkier, I just wish this was a better fit because it's adorable. :)"}

I cruised the gowns on the website and looked for women my size, worked with a stylist while ordering and had the dresses, a 10R and 12R just a few days later. The 12R was very tight so I called delivery day and they sent a 14R and it arrived the next day. The 14R was a bit big and the 12R was a bit tight but still zippable. Both gowns were a bit long for my 5'4\" height and I was wearing 5 inch heels.  Next time I will use the hem tape (which they send with the dress).   All 3 gowns were beautiful, clean, and in a great condition. After my event where I got unending compliments, I put in the UPS envelope and sent back. So easy and I looked fabulous!"}

I've got a big booty so I ended up wearing the XL where there was a little more room. It was a little big on the top and I felt like I had to keep adjusting it all night so my girls didn't slip out, but wearing a strapless bra helped fill it out a bit. Overall, I really liked the look and if the material would have been even the slightest bit stretchy that would have been nice. Super classy and fun with the slit and ruffle. I normally wear a size 8  or 10 depending on the style and designer for reference. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The dress looks like it's worth millions thanks to all the sparkle.  The fabric (covered in dark blue shimmery sequins) is stretchy so it can accommodate many body flaws and easy to sit down in.  I have a wide rib cage and could have fit in the 8L zipped up half way (there's a fabric panel like the front that covers the back and would cover the up zipped zipper) but choose to wear the 10L fully zipped for comfort.  The length on the 8L was perfect, the 10L about 1\" too long with my 2-1/2\" heels (light blue satin slingbacks) but instead of using the provided Hollywood tape, I pulled the dress up a bit in the waist and it fell like a natural rouching (there was some there already).  The only issue was that a couple people were stepping on the back of my dress so I had to be careful to pick up the dress as I walked.  I received so many complements about the fit being so good (lots of spanx and a strapless bra) and I only had to wear a couple of large drop earrings (costume jewelry) since the dress was such a statement.  After the event many of my girlfriends were trying to get me to buy the dress as they thought it was a keeper!  I got one other dress (black one shoulder, long) to choose as I never had used RTR before but there was no question once I got the dresses that this was the one I would wear.  The packaging was excellent (felt luxurious in a garment bag with a little packet of per-event Hollywood tape and shaving cream) and the mailer to send back was just the right size if you fold the gown in thirds. (RTR sent me 2 mailers, 1 for the 2 sizes and 1 for the other kind of dress).  Overall the whole experience was FANTASTIC."}

The fabric is also very thin and not great quality. It wrinkled after I'd had it on 20 minutes. Overall, I would not rent it again.

I ended up wearing the six. As people have mentioned, the sleeves are pretty constricting, but I did not mind and did not notice much. I don't know if the dresses were purchased at the different times, but they were very different. The eight actually was smaller than the six. The material of the eight was much different than the six and felt much cheaper. Also, the eight had a gold zipper while the six had a silver one. Just something to keep in mind - I was shocked to get essentially two different dresses! Overall though, a great experience as always!"}

It also has pockets!  And the pockets don't make it poke out at all.  It was comfortable but sexy!\n\nI found that the tan slip underneath sometimes poked out, but wasn't too big of a deal"}

I'm 5'2\" and this was a good length for me.  I got the size 2 and 4, and the 4 really fit very well.  I got a lot of compliments.  This was a great rental because it was so unique and memorable.

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "Wore to my son's high school graduation in Boston (May 2017). Perfect choice. Dress came to the knee on me which was what I had hoped, ran a little large, top quality fabric, very well-made. Normally wear 8 but 6 fit amazing. Suggest getting your normal size and sizing down for second option. Pair this with Zac Posen navy / red / cream wristlet that was just enough to accentuate the navy dress and cream enamel side buttons. Only minor issue was armhole area was squared and low so every now and then my nude bra could peek through. You might want to find a lower dropping one for this dress but completely minor issue. People were stopping me all over to ask about the outfit. So crazy comfortable too. Felt beautiful, cool, comfortable and proud for ceremony and dinner on waterfront afterwards. Going to watch Tory Burch sales and buy this one when it goes on sale at end of season. Would wear this again for any event, it's a keeper and a classic. Thanks, RTR! "}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "I love this so much but things to take into consideration: it is a rather large fit. I am normally an 8 -10 and I got the 6 and even that is huge on me. I still love it, and wearing it more slouchy look. It is quite light/thin, so in a NY winter you will need a leather jacket underneath and a scarf to be warm/better for fall. It is completely reversible with a silver inside which is amazing, so essentially two coats. The buttons I think are supposed to be magnetic and they don't work so forget doing it up. Because it is a large fit it sort of just closes around you anyway - but it was a little annoying that the buttons didn't work when it was really chilly out."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "The dress is very stretchy which was awesome and the material was on the thick side which I also appreciated.  The material is good at hiding bumps and lumps and allowed for any underwear to be worn underneath.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because the dress kept riding up all night and I kept having to pull my dress down.  Because of this, this dress was not for me, but I would definitely recommend this dress if you have something to hold the dress in place. "}

If it feels weirdly tight in the hip area, unzip and re-arrange the lining/middle layer/top before sizing up. \nMy hips at the time were 44\" and the 12 fit snugly but not unattractively so. "}

That made it very elegant, but I also had to be very careful on stairs and avoiding puddles.  There was a lot of extra fabric in the bust, which I didn't like (and which made me look much rounder than I am).  If it were my own dress, I would have taken a few inches off the \"straps\" so that it fit more tightly up top.  I covered the extra fabric with a sheer shawl.  I did get numerous compliments.  The color and fabric feel very luxurious."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I love this jacket. The leather is soft and the pockets have fleece inside which feels great on a cold night. I rented a Medium but would probably size up to a large so I could wear a bulkier sweater underneath. The one drawback is that when zipped up the waist was tight on me, it's sort of a triangle silhouette, which is flattering but impractical depending on your weight and outfit. Wearing the jacket out I honestly felt I got better service than I normally would - either this jacket says treat me well or I was acting more confident in it. I was trying it out to see if I'd actually wear a black leather jacket and the answer is YES!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "Pros: beautiful color, the lace cut outs are great as well\nCons: i rented this for christmas and realized that it was a bit too low cut for my liking.  I guess because the model in the picture doesnt have large boobs, i didnt pay much attention when i was renting.  I am 5'10\" and it barely touched the ground so with heels it was not long enough (even though i rented the long).  The top was a bit large for a B cup without a bra but perfect with a bra.  My biggest issue was the cut around the bottom area; around the butt area was snug for someone with a little more down there which then made the dress lay odd around the stomach area as it kept pulling up. \n\nI would say this dress is best for someone that isnt too curvy, especially on the bottom half.  You also must be comfortable with a very low neckline.  Other than that is it a lovely dress"}

The Gala was black-tie optional and I wore a floor length gown last year, so I knew if I was going to go for a short dress, it had to be special.  This dress is very pretty and sparkly with all the sequins and was perfect for the event!  My husband joked that sequins are from the 50s (like he knows fashion haha) but I told him I was bringing sequins back :)  I wear between a 10 and a 12 and the 12 fit okay, but the 10 was definitely a better fit for me.  I also had to use a bit of the fashion tape that RTR sent me to have the top fit well without showing my bra.  I was able to wear a regular tradition bra with this dress which was nice.  It's really hard to describe the color of this dress, it's not as silver as it looks in the picture.  It has a pink/ gold tint to it, but I loved that.  The hardest thing for me was finding the best shoes to match.  I ended up going with a pair of ivory shoes that worked well.  I would say if you can find a pair of gold with skinny straps, that they would be perfect.  Overall, I really loved the dress and got a lot of compliments considering everyone else at the Gala looked fantastic!"}

While the 12 was tight around my bootie, I wasn't uncomfortable. And the difference in the looseness of the top between the 12 and 14 was impressive. The fit between the two sizes around my midsection and bottom wasn't very different.\nThe only downside had nothing to do with wearing the dress; it was pretty easy to get on and off without help (just don't unzip beyond the bodice bit).

This was my first Rent the Runway experience, and while not all went as originally planned, this dress was everything I was hoping for! Although I know you can rent some great dresses here for a lot less, this dress was absolutely worth it. I felt sexy yet modest at the same time, which was perfect for the wedding I attended. LOVE.\n\nIn terms of details, you can tell from the fabric that it is a quality-made, runway-worthy dress. It is absolutely fitted, so I am so glad I sized up to a 10 (I tend to fall between 8 and 10). Any tighter would have been too much. Despite how tight it is, it still passed the \"dance test,\" and it really flattered my curves. Aside from a little bit of zipper difficult and mild puckering in the back, it fit like a glove. The material is pretty thick and a little heavier than I thought, but it made for a unique, structured look. Luckily, we were in air conditioned venues, otherwise the July heat in Florida may have been a little much.  The on-trend ruffle cold shoulder sleeves covered my sunburn and any unwanted arm jiggle, while still keeping things cool during our night of dancing. It was easy to wear a strapless bra and may not have even been necessary. The color was vibrant without being obnoxious. Overall, I would rent this dress again in a heartbeat! Obsessed!!"}

The neckline was perfect for a full bust, as it showed very minimal cleavage but lots of pretty collarbone.  I tried on the XL too and the only difference for me was that it bunched a little at my shoulders.   The dress is very comfortable.  Loved it!"}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "The color was probably my favorite part of the dress, the blue color is really nice. The dress is supposed to be loose and flowy but I still would have wanted it to be a little tighter. I'm 5ft8 and the dress was fine length wise but was pretty short when sitting! I would definitely rent from RTR again, just might not get this dress. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I love this print-- pairs well with jeans and a dark t-shirt for a casual workplace. The fabric is a bit shinier than my usual taste but not cheap-looking. Has no closure but is well-tailored and fits closely."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "LOVE the color of this dress and the flowy sleeves will have you wanting to talk with your hands a lot! The only downside is that it is tight in the chest and runs on the shorter side. I got away with wearing an 8 as long as I remembered to keep my arms down."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "the 4 regular fit me better through the bust, but was too short.  The 4 long was a bit loose in the bust, but I needed the additional length.

I played it a little too safe in this dress."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This is a shift dress, so it's not made to be form fitting or tucked in at the waist.  I loved the asymmetric hem and the medium thickness and softness of the material.  No need for a slip and you can wear any bra.  I think most designer brands run small compared to everything else in my closet so I ordered a size up.  I think I could have worn the 12, but found the 14 super comfortable and got tons of complements.  I forgot to take a picture, but I wore this with black tights and black leather boots.  It would work equally well with heels or flats, but in the Fall I'm a boot girl.  I'll definitely rent this again."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore this for a fiesta engagement party. I loved the pattern and colors. I have a smaller chest and larger hips,/bottom so I was leaning towards a 4.

I received a lot of compliments and would love to rent again!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore this to a wedding and got so many compliments all night. I am typically a size 8 but every once and a while am a 6. I wore the 6. Fit perfect. Arm holes were a little snug and the sequins rubbed a little but nothing that in the end bothered me. I read a lot of reviews before I settled up this dress because my concern was if the dress I ordered was going to be too short as I have long legs. It was perfect. Didn't ride up. Could wear a normal bra and undies. Didn't have to worry about wrinkles or water stains. It was nice to stand out and not wear your typical black dress that you see at so many weddings."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I got the small and the medium as a backup. Both fit well but I didn't want to need a bra so I opted for the small. My one pet peeve was the zipper. It was a little hard to zip the dress by myself and even my sister struggled to get a decent grip on it to get me in the dress. Overall I loved the way it looked on me and the weight of the fabric was nice. Just be aware that the dress definitely highlights the girls. If you're busty or more modest it may not be the dress for you."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore this for a daytime formal luncheon in early summer, and got so many compliments! The pattern is a beautiful colorful floral against a cream background.

I ordered the regular length as my backup size and it was far too short. I was a little uncomfortable in my mid section at times since the fabric is thinner. It did not hug too tight, but it didn't hide anything either. I really did not care for this dress at first, so much so that I contacted customer service to try to get another one. I received the dress too late in the day to have one overnighted in time for the event, so I tried it on again and was actually so glad I was stuck with it. Another successful RTR experience!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I was so happy with this dress! It was the first time I've used RTR and I needed something to wear to the rehearsal dinner of a wedding in which I was the maid of honor. It fit like a glove and accentuated my hourglass figure. I received many compliments throughout the evening. My arms were definitely restricted, but there is some elastic in the back of the sleeves to help you out. Personally, I would have been disappointed to wear this to a wedding because I wouldn't have been able to move my arms to dance very much! The fabric is high quality, but didn't breath much, so I would avoid it for outdoor events in the summertime. Also, in some photos, the dress appears black and white, but it is definitely blue!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "Wore this dress for my birthday, and I got it free with my RTR membership. You'll need to wear a strapless bra. Also, I have a large bust and noticed the space between the 1st and 2nd buttons didn't lay flat, especially when I was sitting. It created a large gap, too. I wish I had a pin for it. Going a size up might have helped, but then I think I would have been swimming in the dress. Overall I loved the color and the shape of the dress."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I ordered an 8 and a 10.  Both fit very well.  I have bigger upper arms and the lace sleeves were semi-tight.  I could have worn it, but I wasn't sure how comfortable it would have felt after being on for 10+ hours (dressing at 12:30 p.m. and wearing until 11 p.m.), so I opted for the 10.  I was very comfortable in it.  The color was GORGEOUS! It was very berry!  I also was the only one wearing a bright color at the reception!  I got many compliments!  I would highly recommend this dress."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Amazing dress! Pictures don't do it justice...the sleeves ride up when I held the camera making it look wider than it was. The 10 actually fit nicely (lots of room for us busty ladies...I'm 36 DD), but I opted for the 12 to allow for comfortable dancing, etc. The color and sleeves are AMAZING!! I would rent this again for an air conditioned or cool weather event."}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "I rented this blindly (no reviews!) for a beach wedding rehearsal dinner, and it was perfect. I'm 5'9 and it hit me right below the knees. The fabric has a nice weight to it that provides great movement, but isn't too heavy. The scoop neckline and zipper detail and front pocket placement give it a little something special. The one reviewer mentioned it ran large, and I'd agree. I'm a usual size 8 in most dresses (though sometimes between sizes, so in this case it worked well for me) and I wore the 6 which fit great. I would size down for your backup. I also rented the necklace for RTR, and loved the two together. VERY happy with these rentals. "}

I also don't think the dress photographed well (all of the pictures are a bit unflattering).

I am curvy and tall (5'10') so the 8L was just the right length wearing 4inch heels. The neckline is so beautiful and there are elastic straps built in to the shoulders so they don't slide down your arms.

I'm a D cup but that wasn't the issue, it's snug in the rib cage area. Wished it had a little more stretch, but then I think it would compromise the sturdy form look. Still a beautiful dress and loved the L size. Was a little long and people couldn't see my shoes, but still a great dress to wear. The color is neat too, it changes depending on the light.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress is a little bit tricky. I'm typically in between a size 4 and 6 for dresses, 26-27 in denim. The reviews stating this dress runs small had me concerned about which sizes to order. Hoping I wouldn't need an 8, I ordered the 4 and 6. When I tried the 4 on, without zipping it up, while the body fit nicely, I was worried the arms would be far too small. As soon as you fully zip the dress, however, the tightness in the arms goes away and you lose the pull in the armpits \u2013 it fits almost like an entirely different dress. The 6 would have looked frumpy and large, the high neck and conservative length require a tight fit to look youthful. I would say it's a fitted true-to-size. Nonetheless, if you tend to size up when cuts are extremely tailored, that may work best for you. The lace detailing and color are beautiful, but I had to add some trendy heeled sandals and a big blowout to keep from looking matronly. At the end of it all, I received many compliments \u2013 it's a quality dress!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Fun and flirty cocktail dress while offering a sophisticated silhouette. Running true to size, I suggest sizing up for your backup. You can wear any standard bra with this dress and it seems perfect for someone with a fuller bust. It seems to be fitted throughout the midsection as it is belted at the waist. However, the fuller skirt provides comfortable room for the hips. It seems to be knee length on my petite frame."}

I didn't wear a bra as the extra padding made it a little snug in the chest.

Definitely can't recommend this garment enough!"}

I have big hips and a very small waist, so only thing that saved me here was the fabric-which is VERY stretchy and formed by body. Would recommend but a size down. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The color of the dress is amazing! a little brighter than pictured on me since the sun was going down. I didn't like that the lining was longer than the lace but that's about it. no need for a necklace as it takes away from the beautiful dress. Just did earrings and a bracelet. Fit true to size. Ordered a 6 and fit as expected. I wore a NuBra and it worked great with the dress. Nude shoes work best because just like the jewelry, with this dress you son't want anything to detract from it because it's beautiful all by itself. Highly recommend it!!!"}

When I saw the sequins online I wholeheartedly expect that it would irritate my arms from the rubbing all night, and it did just the opposite. I have an hourglass body shape (well, my butt is pretty big in comparison to my upper body, with a small waist) and this dress accentuated my body perfectly. It wasn't too tight along the bottom so I could walk with long strides as I usually do. Usually I can take an 8 in some dresses if they are formfitting enough to still give me some breathing room, but the 6 was perfect, otherwise the 8 would be way too loose the chest.

The lower back is very sexy, and the small shoulder pads give a good balance to the shape of the dress. I opted for the smaller size; I typically wear a 4 but went with the 2 because it fit around my waist a little tighter and created a better silhouette.

However, there is a lot of good things about this romper! The style and material are both great, with the material being very high quality. The mesh doesn't feel thin so you are not worried about breaking it. I think the design is so cute! Very sophisticated and sexy at the same time. However, I would need an XXXS in this I think. Definitely runs big so go a size down. I have a long torso and it was still a good length at XS if not still being a little too long. Also, excuse my dirty mirror in the pic."}

The sleeves of the size 4 felt like they may slip off my shoulder and show my bra straps so I opted for the size 2 which was almost too snug (but ended up stretching out a bit and worked great)! Overall the dress was super fun to wear with the tulle bottom. I have a larger bust so I love that I could wear a bra with it without anything showing.  Beware of bending over!

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I chose this dress because it was the perfect combination of sleek and sexy for a formal wedding.  The red is quite bright and on the orange side, more of a tomato. Didn't even notice the modest single side slit in the photos, but it was a nice surprise that made the dress even easier to move in.  Keep in mind this dress is woven and won't give at all. The 2 absolutely would not fit on my upper arms properly and pulled at my chest so I opted for the 4, my usual size in designer clothes, even though it was not quite as form hugging as I'd have preferred. I'm 5'5\"-5'6\"ish and the hem length didn't bother me but if you are a few inches taller like the model in the picture it will hit you right at or a little below the knee and be a very flattering length.  It was easy to dance with and the material doesn't cling too much so I could wear a strapless bra without seeing any hints of it through the dress. The sleeves stayed on through a night of dancing and were quite comfortable without slipping down. The only thing I will note is that these gorgeous flamenco-inspired sleeves can become a little inconvenient at dinner--be sure not to drag them in your plate of food when you reach for your glass!

It is a little thicker which was perfect for the winter and kept me very warm. It flowed wonderfully and I received tons of compliments on it. I love this dress and want to buy it now! "}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "I ordered a small in this dress and a medium as a backup size.  I received only the medium and a completely different dress in the wrong size!!

I typically wear a size 4 in everything else in life.  This dress was great on - though if you are trying to hide a belly, this might not be for you.  I wore a pair of spanx comfortably underneath, but none of my regular bras worked with this dress without a strap being visible.  I opted for the trusty \"sticky bra\" once again.  My legs are pretty long and this came to just below my knee, as pictured.  The sequins underneath my arms did not start irritating me until 4-5 hours in the dress.  I have sensitive skin, but there were no red marks where it was rubbing.  Overall, this dress looked great on, was \"one of a kind\" at the party I attended, and was easy to move around in.  I would definitely rent this one again!"}

I wore 6 inch heels with a bit of a platform and the dress hung about 1/2 inch from the floor in the front and slightly longer in the back- it was perfect and had the look of a train without too much fabric trailing behind me. Because the beaded waistline added a bit of drama I didn't feel the need to accessorize at all- I just wore simple diamond studs. I loved the heavy fabric of this dress too- it looked very expensive and draped beautifully. I opted not to wear a bra and was comfortable because the fabric didn't show a thing.  Mostly I ABSOLUTELY loved the pockets- I kept my iPhone on me at all times- it was ideal!! "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 3, "review": "This dress is one of the most popular dresses on RTR for a reason. It's a stunning color, great lace detail, and has pockets. I decided to rent this to wear as a guest at a friend's large Southern wedding. However, when I got to the wedding another girl was wearing the same dress from RTR!! This girl and i chatted at the reception and laughed about it- guess it's bound to happen with such a popular dress. So caution if you rent this, it's a stand out dress and it made the rental less fun because we matched. Also, the dress was way too short on my 5'8'' frame, so not the best dress for tall girls. Both the 2 and the 4 fit but i went with the 4 for the extra length. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I'm so obsessed with this color! This jumpsuit is perfect for Fall. It runs very true to size and the Medium was perfect. You definitely can't wear a bra with this jumpsuit, so it didn't really work out well for me (that's why you can see my bra poking out a little) but it would work much better for someone who can go braless! The Regular was the perfect length with about 3\" heels and the fabric doesn't have any stretch."}

Love this website!"}

I'm 5'7 and even with three-inch heels, I was tripping over the hem of the dress. I ended up going barefoot and just holding the dress up when I walked. It's a shame because this dress is gorgeous. The fabric is light and flowy, it's a very flattering cut, it's so comfortable, the colors are rich. It was perfect for a destination beach wedding. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress was great! The style of the dress is very classic, but the neckline and fabric give it a modern twist. Be warned: \"iridescent\" is a strong word for what the fabric looks like. At first I was a little put off, because what I thought would be an iridescent polyester, almost silk fabric, was thicker fabric with what I consider \"glitter\" thread woven into it.  That being said, it was my \"just in case\" dress, so I didn't look at the description too carefully. \n\nThe fit of the dress is pretty true to size. I ordered an 8 and a 10. I tried on the 8 and it fit well, but I tried on the 10 to see if it would be a little more comfortable. There was VERY little difference between the two except getting what felt like a cm of extra room in the rib cage and the arm holes a little bigger. Definitely recommend ordering a size up. I ended up wearing the 10 as opposed to the 8 so that I could be more comfortable. \n\nYou cannot wear a bra in this dress unless you choose to wear a cami underneath to make it more modest. However, the fabric is thick and your girls won't be all over the place. Be warned though - the girls WILL BE OUT. I am not super well-endowed in the bust but definitely was showing tasteful cleavage. So be prepared. Girls with AA-B/C cups can probably get away with at most pasties, but ladies with a bigger bust that need more support may want to tape or get a silicone sticky bra. "}

I'm pretty petite so I was worried about the length and not having a short size option.

It is true to fit and if you don't want to trip over yourself all night the regular works perfectly for a girl my height. I wore 4\" heels with it and it was exactly the right length. The fabric is lovely and hides any imperfections but you might want to break out your spanx just in case :) I have a very small waist and my only complaint was that though the overall fit is true to size for an hourglass girl its a little roomy through the ribcage and waist. This leads to an amazing frontal view but not an awesome profile. Though I was just happy with the dress everyone else at the event raved about how dramatic the red was and how elegant and sophisticated I looked. It definitely makes a statement and as a mother of two young ones, it was the appropriate one to make"}

They weren't too different except that the 6R had a bit more fabric bunching up right at the waistline. Unless you are a true 2 I would highly recommend getting the 4R, and the 6R as back up, depending on the size of your bust. Sometimes I can wear a 2 depending on the dress, but I don't think the 2 would have fit me. This dress is fun, photographs well (especially while dancing and twirling), and made me feel so pretty. ***Look out for the long tulle back when getting out of vehicles or standing up from a seated position. Your heels can easily catch the back of the dress and tear the tulle. "}

I had to safety pin it under the ruffles and use double sided tape all the way around it.

The dress was very comfortable and I enjoyed wearing it. I also rented the Kendra Scott cobalt blue earrings to match. They looked great but are HEAVY. They're bigger (and heavier) than the Kendra Scott's that I currently own. They were fine for the whole night, but my earlobes were very sore when I got home. I was happy that I only rented them for $10 instead of investing the retail price for them. This was my second RTR dress and I'm just as pleased the second time as I was the first.

My husband forgot to bring my Squeem (if you don't know what that is then look it up on amazon) and my period was getting ready to start. Ugh! I have a thick waist line anyway so I need something to usually hold me in the waist to give me the hourglass shape. I couldn't wear a bra with it as the back dips low and I wish I had a shot of it. If someone in the wedding gets one I will add. I was not in the wedding party but I got HUGE AND MANY COMPLIMENTS from everyone...yes even gorgeous women!

This was not a question of the dress being to small either, there was plenty of wiggle room.  At the belt, it would not zip.  My fiance and photographer all tried everything.  We ended up leaving the dress halfway unzipped and my photographer photoshopped each picture where you could see it. "}

I was nervous at first because I thought it was just going to look like a silly blob in front of my dress but after a bit of practice my husband and I figured out a cute little knot that worked for us.

I usually wear a 8 in dresses.  The only long option was 10L, i took a chance and got it, and it fit!  I will say it definitely was not as long as I would like.  I had to go find some flats, even my shortest heels would make it too short.  With gowns, you have to have it slightly touching the ground or it looks funny.  This dress fit awesome (minus the length) I wore a regular bra and didn't need to wear any spax or anything!  I felt like a sexy pregnant mermaid.  The pics definitely don't do it justice.

RTR was a hit once again!!!"}

Word to the wise - you can wear this with a regular bra, but it has to be the right kind.. I  packed the wrong one which I hadn't tried on with the dress, and you could see the back strap. I was able to go bra-free with no issues. Not sure if I would rent again because the sizing was a little off, but maybe I'll lose enough weight to fit into the 8 next time! Easy to move in, though the cut is quite narrow at the knees, so beware walking up stairs or trying to keep up with tall people ;) "}

I also would have been happy if the dress had been maybe an inch or two longer; I'm 5'10 and I could barely wear heels with it, which is strange because other dresses I've rented at this length have felt to be the perfect length. On the positives, the silhouette  can't be beat, the dress fits like a glove through the hips with enough stretch to be comfortable but still hold you in, the fabric is heavy enough that you don't have to constantly tug it down, and the color is rich and beautiful.

The waist part was a little higher than my natural waist which really flattered my body and the flair was just the right amount to flatter without making you look like a big bubble.

I loved the color and wanted something that would pop in a sea of black, and this dress certainly did that! I received many compliments on this dress in person and on photos I took at the wedding. I enjoyed this dress and it was fun to wear, but I had the following issues with it:\n1) The top is REALLY difficult to fit correctly. It's extremely low cut, which I'm comfortable with, but the main issue was with the length of the straps and \"gaping\". If I hadn't have been wearing a low-cut bra, a safety pin, and tons of sticky tape, this dress would have gaped open and shown way too much! \n2) Straps are really long - if you don't have a long torso or are on the short side you may have an issue with how this dress is really long in the body. I felt like the body length of the dress was made for a taller person and the body length didn't hit me in the right places and contributed to the \"gaping\" even though the length of the skirt was fine. Unfortunately, straps are a hard fix when you can't sew a dress.\n\nBottom line: if you are petite, have a small rib cage and not a long torso, you might have the same issues with this dress that I did. However I did enjoy that the dress hugged my curves and people loved the color at the black tie wedding."}

Only negative about this dress is that it RUNS SHORT. I am 5 6 and ordered the long just in case and even with only 2 inch heels could see my feet so I ended up not wearing heels. Other than that it is amazing! Zipper is also difficult to work and zip up so don't freak out if it doesn't fit at first, you just may need some help. Also, there is no need for an additional bra underneath cause it fits snug up tight. I would advise if you have a larger chest to get a size bigger.

{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore a size 2 of this dress to an October wedding and it was perfect! I read all the reviews before renting and decided to order a size 2 and a 4 as a backup. I normally wear a size 2 in dresses/skirts if I want a more fitted look and a 4 if I want a looser fit. My butt is disproportionately larger than the rest of my body (compared to a narrow waist and 32C bust), so size 2 dresses fit me very well on top and are slightly tight through my butt. The 4 in this dress fit my hips very well, but the back of the dress was a bit loose. The 2 fit me like a glove and looked amazing (having it fitted the whole way through my back really made a difference). It was tight (with no stretch) but comfortable through my ribcage and tight (with stretch) through my hips and butt, so I would recommend ordering a size up as your backup. Although the dress was tight, the stretch in the legs made it easy to walk and stand in. I would imagine that sitting in this dress for many hours would be uncomfortable though with the tightness in the ribcage. I would highly recommend this dress, but definitely keep in mind that it is tailored to fit tight!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "First, while this is technically a dress it's actually only sewn together for a few inches in center front.  This makes it a little tricker to get off and on, but since the material is stretchy it's not a big deal. The dress' strong lines, interesting draping in the front, and rich color drew me toward it and seemed to be what others loved, too!  Stretch material is quite thin so I wore a slip to avoid cling and sheerness in sun.\n\nRe size/length: I'd say TTS, but I have straight hips. Top was generously cut, full bust was fine; skirt is fairly straight so if your curves are more front-to-back than side-to-side maybe start TTS, otherwise you may want to consider sizing up. Though I'm 5'4 I have a *really* high waist, so while skirt was a midi it didn't fall as long on me as it would on someone with a more typical waist."}

It does look fine with a blazer if you need to business-it-up, but still looks very work appropriate and classy without. I paired with some simple studs, and loved it! I also sized up, and went with an XL (whereas usually I fluctuate between a M and L), because I read the other reviews and didn't want it too clingy for an interview. If you're wearing it somewhere where clinginess isn't a problem, then I would probably go with your normal size, but if you want a little bit more room (but still a very nice shape) then go a size up.

Luckily this thing did not wrinkle and stayed perfect. The fit was spot on (although the zipper in the back was a little \"sticky\" and I had to really pull to zip up. I wore 3in wedges and the dress just barely dragged on the ground but didn't bother me at all (I danced as well, didn't get in the way at all). Other than that, the dress was perfect for a spring wedding (outside) and the color was so beautiful. I got so many compliments on it!"}

It's a really classy dress, and the back is especially beautiful. Also, the floral skirt and beaded back made it a little more fun than just a plain black dress. I would say it's a great choice for a more formal event and probably good in any season, although I wore it in the summer. As far as a bra, I felt like all I could wear was one of the sticky bras that don't show anything in the back, otherwise straps will probably show. I got so many compliments and loved wearing it!!"}

Paired with some cute taupe wedges and red lipstick!  My husband LOVED it and wants me to buy it.  I am considering it."}

I wore sticky boobs - you can't wear a regular bra with the back. The material is a lot lighter (more thin) than I expected and has a lot of stretch - doesn't really cover up or smooth out 'imperfections'. The length was great with heels - Due to some unfortunate blisters, I wore platform sandals which were a little too tall in the front. I'm 5'5, about 135 and typically a 4, but sometimes size up to 6 for fit/comfort. I did not bring full coverage underwear and due to the cinching on the back of the dress left very little to the imagination with the backside (you can start to see in the first pic and mirror pic). If I'd had full coverage or spanx, I would have gone with the 4. If you're interested in the dress - you should go for it. "}

I received many, many compliments on the hot pink color-I guess it looked great on my sunburned/tanned skin. :) Originally the wedding was supposed to be outdoors (ceremony, reception and dancing) BUT it started to rain (in SAN DIEGO!!!).  This dress was the  perfect choice for sunshine or rain. I chose to wear with nude wedges and felt just like the dress-GORGEOUS!

I threw on a jeans jacket and it looked pretty good altogether."}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress definitely has an old glamour feel - pair it with red lips and you'll be channeling the 1920s! Beautiful detailing on the front, particularly with the scalloped bottom. The cap sleeves were also very comfortable. Now, the dress is backless and you have to be completely comfortable wearing it that way. My boyfriend wasn't feeling the backless look (boo hiss!) so I alternated between showing the back with my hair to the front (first picture) and wearing my leather jacket (second picture). Both looks were great, although there was definitely more of a \"Wow\" factor sans jacket. You will not be able to wear a standard bra, obviously, so either invest in a NuBra or if you completely forget to pack one (like I did), you will have to go sans bra. I'm also a 4/6 and the dress was slightly tight as a size 6. Again, this may be attributed to my hitting up the buffet quite a lot while I was in Vegas, but I can't be exactly sure so definitely do size up if you choose to rent! "}

The other dress was cute but this was definitely the more comfortable choice by far.  I typically hate pockets on dresses but you couldn't tell it had any unless I actually put my hands in them.

My only complaint about this dress (and why I am not giving it all 5 stars) is that it has wire piping in chest, and on both of my dresses, the piping was sticking out on one side.

You can do a racer-back bra or a strapless bra, but standard bra straps will show on your shoulders. If you are curvier or have a bigger bust, I recommend sizing up since the fabric does not have stretch to it and it is fairly fitted up top. However, the waist is stretchy, which is a huge plus for comfort! Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this jumpsuit and I look forward to renting it this summer!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "The dress was light, airy and great for an unseasonably warm May weekend.  The straps were wide enough to wear a comfy, everyday bra. The dress rode up slightly but not more than any other dress of a similar fit.  It was long enough in the front and the back to provide ample coverage, and held close to my body when it was breezy.  The one thing I would say is there isn't much give in the bust and ribcage area; however, there was a bit too much width in the hips. I contemplated a belt to cinch it in a bit, but that didn't work with the cut of the dress since the waist was high. In the end, I was comfortable in the dress.  The pockets were a huge plus, too - great for stashing my phone between taking photos.  The pattern was really stylish and stood out among all the solid dresses."}

Rather, it's curve hugging in the extreme.  Although the 8 (44) fit true to size, I decided it was a little too close for comfort for a professional event.

The fit was great and hugged my curves well, plus the cutout in the back made me feel a little extra, which is great for a date with the boyfriend. However, I was disappointed with the fabric. It was a cool textured, glittery fabric, but it was too thin to even cover the indent from my tights. It was also already a little frayed in spots when I received it, with a couple threads hanging loose (no big deal - cutting a couple threads is easy), but as the night went along, I noticed the dress catching on my jacket and purse - an issue I've never experienced with either the jacket or purse before. With a better fabric, this dress would be fantastic! But I was just the least bit disappointed."}

The pants hit right at my ankle (I'm 5'1) and the top part was the perfect length-- I'm short waisted so sometimes jumpsuits are too long in the torso. I felt confident in this jumpsuit. It was classic yet not boring-- I was the only person wearing a jumpsuit! I opted to wear a skinny silver belt with it to break up the navy. My only gripes about the jumpsuit: The zippers were a little sticky on both sizes I ordered. I was also in between the two sizes I received.

The v in the front wasn't too deep either. The dress has some cool texture to it, which added some dimension. Definitely recommend."}

I was nervous that the 4 was going to be too big and a 2 wasn't available so I took the risk and only got one size--but it was fine. I probably could have used the 2 for my bust, so I just wore a bra to fill it out better. I think this dress would definitely be better for girls with a bigger chest who want to show that off. I thought the skirt was a little too poofy/bulky but was fun to twirl in."}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "This jacket was so different than what I was expecting. \nFrom the model photo, I was thinking the fabric would be tweed-like and heavier. Instead, it is black and white speckles. The jacket is a light-weight viscose, lined in the arms, allowing you to roll up the sleeves and show the black lining. It is not lined in the body. \nSome reviewers mentioned the shoulder pads. They aren't really 80's style shoulder pads- they are more like the cutlets in a swimsuit or sports bra that add structure. The jacket fabric is thin, so they are needed so the piece has a structured, tailored form. They don't look puffy or big. \nI have large /wide arms and a big bust, so I size up in jackets. This will be big on smaller people, or you'll easily be able to use this as a layering piece with a sweater and collared shirt underneath.\nAll in all, it is a well-tailored jacket that creates a trim silhouette, in a fun print."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore this dress for a friend's company Christmas party and it was perfect! It is very form fitting but the thicker fabric makes it a little forgiving and a lot more comfortable. The back is definitely a head turner.

In the right size, the material looks like it would fall beautifully and it didn't feel heavy or itchy.

If you have problem areas (stomach) and large chest, this dress is great for minimizing the stomach and giving you some great cleavage!

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress was true to size and helped create curves where I had none - I could see this being great for many body types. The skirt is fuller than the picture looks but is not too over the top. The only thing to consider is that the plastic boning in the bodice was bent in several places when I received the dress and the only way to flatten them out was to place several large books on the bodice for a couple days before the event. They did flatten out enough but I was glad to have those extra couple days before my event. This event had dinner and dancing and some walking and the dress was perfect for all situations. I really did get compliments all night and on social media - this is such a fun dress, I highly recommend it! "}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "If you have a small chest this dress may not work for you. I normally avoid strapless dresses because of having a small bust/narrow rib cage. I figured I'd give this one a shot because of the reviews saying it runs small. Unfortunately, I didn't find this to be the case and had to wear a very padded bra and pull it up frequently throughout the night. This dress would look fabulous on someone who is more curvy. Other than this problem, the dress is beautiful, comfortable, and fun to wear. It is somewhat constricting of your movement when you walk due the hem that falls below the knees where the flare starts. "}

With the way the top is cut in, I had some unflattering armpit fat with a strapless bra. The dress was very long, i'm 5'4\" and wore 5 inch wedge platform sandals and it still touched the ground, however the slit made it easy to walk in as it just flowed behind me. Perfect fabric for a hot and muggy country club wedding."}

It's the kind of dress someone with a smaller bust loves (no bra required and no worries about anything popping out), and I got a ton of compliments on it. The color, too, is spectacular. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it didn't look totally amazing with tights (my husband said it did, but I thought it would have been better without them), and I couldn't get a great photo in it. Part of the joy of renting a designer dress is getting a spectacular photo that makes you feel sexier than you do on a normal day. Still, I would love to rent it again in the summertime to see if wearing it with open-toe heels gives me a different feeling. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I got both the small and medium.  The small was tight in the shoulder/arm area but fit everywhere else.  Medium was what i ended up wearing. a bit looser but i could actually move my arms/shoulders.  the length was good but the lining kept dropping and by the end of the event (3 hour later) it was down almost 2 inches from the hem of the dress... aside from that, it was fantastic!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I can' tell you how excited I was to wear this jumpsuit. I absolutely LOVE the Paper Crown label, and thought that this looked perfect for an outdoor summer wedding. Plus, having an extremely active toddler to chase around, the pants were a must. I received several compliments at the wedding about how great the outfit looked, and my only complaint (much like others) was that the waist had NO give to it, and the top was both loose AND tight at the same time--loose around the bottom and tight at the rib cage and chest (not great for super chesty girls). Also, the straps were super long, so I had to tie them at my neck which looked cute, but made it very difficult to use the ladies room. I would probably rent this again, but it would be better to buy it and make some alterations. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I am always a size 2 in RT, and this was no exception. I also almost always wear a size 2 in anything else. This fit perfectly. The silk was a beautiful not-stark white, which was more flattering against my pale complexion. The pattern is whimsical and cute. The skirt was lined and a bit clingy, but you could easily wear another slip under if you wanted. The top is unlined, but thick enough that with a nude bra nothing was visible. I think if I was bustier, I might need a cami to keep my bra from showing. I received lots of compliments on this dress and it's hard not to feel like a million dollars draped in quality silk. This was great (and cool/breathable!) for a summer date with my husband at a nice bistro."}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress is even more beautiful that I anticipated! The print and the front slit add a little fun to this otherwise conservative cut. It was almost a little tight (which also made it a little less conservative!)--the zipper was just a touch hard to pull up and was slightly tight around my neck when fully zipped. That said, I wore my hair down so ended up leaving it unzipped slightly (for my comfort) and it wasn't noticeable. The material is on the thicker side which made it a nice choice for the season and made me a little more comfortable since it was on the tighter side. I'd recommend sizing up for your backup. \nThe only real negative about this one was the length. I'm 5'5\" and wore 3\" heels...and it was still about an inch too long. Used a little fashion tape though and that did the trick. My backup was another Solace London pick and the length in the size 8R was just right...so guess there's a little inconsistency with the lengths within the brand. Oh well. Would definitely try another style by Solace London in the future! "}

The dress worked perfectly for both occasions.\n\nIt's a modest, sophisticated cut that ensures you won't be tugging or pulling to keep legs or bust covered.  If you're looking for something with some more oomph or sex appeal this might not be the best choice.  If however, you're looking for lady-like and feminine lines this is ideal.\n\nA few notes: the tie around the waist is quite long, which is preferable to short.  It was just about knee length on me (at 5'4) so not quite as short as it appears on the model.  Well made construction, with buttons and snaps on the inside to keep everything connected.  i also appreciated that the ruffles on the neckline didn't lie strangely, as lesser-quality dresses sometimes do.\n\nThis is the type of dress I probably should buy, as I can see myself wearing it again and again for years to come!\n"}

It's also very long but at 5'5 I didn't really try to fix that with big heels so I'm sure if i'd worn 3 inch or higher heels it would have been better.

The fit was really good though!  And it has pockets!"}

Sadly the dress only came in one size since the other was unavailable but good thing it was the larger size. I wore a strapless nude bra that seamlessly worked with the cut of the top. It'll show but it's not obvious. Wearing pasties May show through the key hole if you lean forward. The sequins was not itchy but the skirt cut was a little restrictive. Definitely not dropping it low in this dress. Paired it with a gunmetal clutch, rose gold heels, and simple rose gold earrings. You don't need much beyond that because the dress is gorgeous. So many compliments all night!! I wish I could wear it again ! Definitely my favorite rental."}

My backup size was a medium and I didn't even bother trying it on - my husband was quite happy with how the small looked on me ;)  There was some minor irritation from the sequins for me on both my arms and my thighs, but it was very minor.

I put it on, fit almost perfectly (a teeny bit to small in the bust but it worked out fine with some fashion tape) and it was super comfortable! I danced the night away and got so many compliments too. Only downside and why I gave it 4 stars, the buttons all down the back made it annoying to go to the bathroom in, so keep that in mind if you plan on drinking a lot lol. "}

The blue is rich enough to pass off for a winter dress; however, the lace is a floral pattern.

I typically wear a size 0/XS and ended up ordering this in an XS as a backup dress. The dress fit perfectly and looked much better on than my first choice dress so I wore this one to the event instead. The dress is not tight fitting but rather form fitting. Was slightly big in the waist/hips; I have an athletic body type so I have a booty and thighs but no hips so this happens often and was barely noticeable. I would absolutely rent this dress again!

I wore this to a non-profit black tie gala, and it was absolutely perfect.  Understated enough for a work-related event, but with enough color and sparkle to stand out in a sea of black.  The blue color, which is a shade between a royal blue and navy, is especially stunning on blondes.  The fit is very flattering, the lace detail is exquisite, the length was perfect with 3 inch heels, AND it has a built-in corset that allows you to wear the dress without a bra (that feature sold it for me!).  My only (very minor) complaints were that the lace overlay didn't completely cover the lining in the bottom front of the dress, although this wasn't an issue with my backup size so it may have just been this one.  Also, mine didn't come with the belt, but it wasn't absolutely necessary.  Overall, there's a reason that this dress is so highly rated."}

When I first tried on the dress I wasn't super excited about it, but once I dressed it up with accessories and a cute clutch I can honestly say I was really feeling myself. The dress was very comfortable and movable, probably because I wore a larger size. The color is great. It's bright and complimentary to almost any skin tone. The material of the dress is thick which I enjoyed because it was pretty windy and chilly when we attended the party. So if you're planning to attend a party in the heat, I wouldn't recommend this dress. However, if your party will be outside in cool weather then this dress work with a nice jacket. "}

The 10R was the perfect length with my 3in heels and when I changed into my flip flops it grazed the ground a little so I had to lift it while walking.

Thought it was hard to get on since zipper doesn't go the entire length of the top. Wore the small with a regular bra and was too tight - pulling at it all day. Also the slit in the front hit exactly the top of the waistband of my midrise jeans, so the slit would kind of sit/get stuck on the button/top of waistband. Think this would look better on someone with a narrower frame (and I should have worn the M!)"}

Even though the dress is very forgiving, if you plan on eating dinner or busting a move at your event, I recommend you size up. The length was perfect in 3 inch heels. The details on this dress are what make it feel so luxurious-- the gold roses are elegant and the bottom of the skirt flows so beautifully. You can't see it very well in the photo, but underneath the tulle it is actually sheer fabric with the gold roses. I didn't wear but a few accessories at all because this dress will definitely catch a lot of attention on its own.

The hook to clasp the dress was missing so the shoulders of the dress would fall down at times and the dress could've been pressed."}

I received so many compliements.  I am 5'11 and the dress could have been a tad longer since it specified that the size was in a \"long\" size.  With heels, it was a tiny bit shorter than I would prefer, but I'mnot sure anyone noticed but me.  This dress fit based on my pregnant measurements (below).

It was the perfect style for the event, a black tie optional wedding in early November in Northern VA. Two cons of this dress--some of the boning in the top was poking through and I had to cover with a band-aid to be able to wear it. I also had to remove some lint/fuzz from the bottom hem--I believe this was a result of washing and wearing so many times. Both I was able to fix for the event."}

I did not need to wear a bra (I'm small chested/ 34B) or any sort of slimming under garnet with this gown. If I personally owned this dress, I would probably have the waist tailored to fit a slightly bit tighter because in some photos the dress looks baggy around my stomach area. "}

And the overall feel of the dress is incredibly luxurious. It's like a mix between cotton and that new \"scuba\" fabric that's becoming so popular.

I would not have felt secure with the one snap. Also, there is no hook on the top of the zipper that holds the top together - so I had to remember to rezip myself because the zipper kept sliding down.

It also looked a little bit cheaper at the edges of the fabric than appeared in the photo but I didn't mind that much. My initial attraction to the dress was the backless aspect. It definitely lived up to it's sexy yet classy appeal. My only gripe with the dress was that I felt it called for accessories that I didn't have. I ended up buying a necklace the day of my event.

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress lays beautifully on your body. There is weight and structure to the fabric so it's form fitting without being too revealing. (It's not super heavy though don't worry). The cutout pattern looks gorgeous. The dress came down to my mid calf. I wore it without a bra. The cutout dips a little lower than I realized but I still felt it was appropriate for my law school reunion. This dress is also great for that 65 degree temp range because of its length. I wore minimal jewelry because I didn't want to be too dressy, but I think this could be easily dressed up for a formal event. Would rent it again in a heartbeat."}

The 4r made me look a little thicker through the midsection, and the sleeves were so thick, they really blended into the body of the dress. However, the 2r felt really tight on my ribs. I am not large chested, but I'd say I do have a larger ribcage. I ended up wearing the 2r and was happy with my choice. I had to have my husband help with the zipper. I don't think you could zip up alone. The dress was the perfect length with my 5 inch heels. "}

The dress is very comfortable, I ended up pairing it with a Betsy Johnson belt that accentuated the tight fit on top.  I liked the detail of the fishnet texture on top, and the flair of the skirt.  The fabric felt very stout.  This would be the perfect dress to wear to a holiday party this winter!"}

I ordered the 6R with the 4R as the 2nd choice. I went with the 4R because the top fit better and I didn't have to worry at all about anything falling out. Not that I would anyway, since I don't have much on top to fall out. But after a few babies, the 4R did keep things in place! The only con I can think of is if you are sitting for a long time, then the boning might get uncomfortable."}

The dress is skin tight (I couldn't wear underwear, is that TMI?), but thick material. It was just stunning."}

I will add that this could be a difficult top to wear...I am larger in the chest and an XS was still a little baggy in that area. With that in mind, for someone with a smaller chest, not sure this would fit right. It could also be a little tough to wear a bra with. I was able to manage a thin bra and it didn't peek thru the sides that much. If you go braless you will definitely need petals! Overall, pretty top and I felt great in it"}

It was a little awkward to sit down in because the inner lining was very tight, just at the bottom.

There are several layers of fabric, so it is somewhat warm. It fit perfectly... the sleeves were snug, and I have skinny arms, so I could see how someone else might need to size up for comfort in the arms. My favorite part is the BRIGHT BLUE! It photographed so well in any lighting!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 3, "review": "I loved the pockets and the overall look of the dress. What I didn't like is how tight the fit was in the bodice, especially at the base of my ribs. The waist seemed high to me too, making me feel shorter than what I already am. The sequins scratched the undersides of my arms and left marks, but those went away soon after I took the dress off. The zipper was also extremely difficult to zip, not because it was a tight fit, because it seemed like a faulty product (both zippers in both dresses had this issue). I was praying that the zipper wouldn't break; fortunately, it did not. I ended up wearing the size 6 because the 8 was too big in the straps and back."}

And because I was recovering from foot surgery and couldn't wear heels, it was the right length to hide the flat strappys that I wore with it. The color was beautiful and this pic does not do it justice. I had to wear this for my 25th high school reunion and needed a showstopper! This was definitely it! I would have normally worn a 12 (48L) but there was a little room in the midsection area.

The small and the medium fit nicely, but I went with the medium for a little more room because I knew I'd be sitting most of the time as well as eating quite a bit of food.  :-)  Comfortable, stretchy just enough without getting too stretched out, and you can wear a regular, skin-toned or black bra, even with the lace on the back.  AND, I didn't have to wear Spanx to feel comfortable in it...definite plus!  Only \"con\" is the neck came right below my chin, so it would get irritating at times; and I have a pretty long neck.  So, warning, if you know you kind of have a shorter neck...it may not work for you.  The zipper in the back goes all the way up, so rolling the neck down wouldn't work.

I slipped this dress on (the size small had plenty of extra room) and looked in the mirror and found that I had instantly gained 25 pounds.

If it helps imagine the sizing, I generally wear a 2-4 or 27 in pants, measured ~27\" waist and ~34\" hips, sometimes I need to size up in my tops due to my shoulders and bust but the Medium fit perfectly everywhere, even in the arms and sleeves.

My shoes did show which I liked, if you are taller and looking for the dress to sweep the floor rent the L. Because I'm in Chicago and didn't want to worry about the hemline getting stained with salt and snow I opted for the shorter length. We had a sizeable dinner so I was grateful that the dress hugs your chest and not your tummy. I also loved the detailing in the lace for the top of the dress. Very beautiful, beyond satisfied, as always!"}

In the picture I am wearing the 10! I was nervous with all the reviews about size that it would be too small as most people got two sizes down but this fit really well. My cleavage looked outstanding (haha), just put some pasties on and the dress held my D cups up all night. The length was appropriate for the event hitting me just above the knee I am 5\"10 for height reference; though I learned if I ran up steps it bounced up and all the bridesmaids saw my situation under the dress. It's got some weight to the fabric but it was easy to pack in my bookbag, no wrinkles! I loved this dress and felt really good in it.  "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress is as perfect as a black (informal) gown can be! Sexy and chick would best describe the overall fit (and forgiving if you would need it to be). The best feature of the gown is that the fabric is rich and thick with an ample amount of  stretch, which makes for hours of comfortable wear. If you're looking for a nearly foolproof way to receive nothing but compliments from women & men alike, rent this gown! \nNote: I wore 3\" heels with the gown and it was still perhaps a smidge long, however, I didn't mind as it was easy enough to navigate without stepping on the hem. Also, the 2L that I received had a lower zipper that could have received a replacement a few rentals prior to mine as it kept falling down. "}

I was definitely sad I couldn't wear the dress I originally wanted, but this dress ended up being a great backup.\n\nI'm short and a little curvy, so I was nervous that the dress wouldn't be fitted enough - baggy things just end up making me look like a potato, as I have a larger bust and hips. But this one came in just enough at the waist without being tight. I was surprised at how flattering it ended up being! Was also very comfortable for moving around and dancing. I didn't find the sequins to be itchy or anything, and the long sleeves were nice for a chilly night. \n\nWas almost too short, wore it to a formal work party and was looking for something conservative yet fun and youthful, and I'd say it fit the bill. Just be careful if you've got a booty! Mine can cause problems sometimes. But as far as I know I didn't have any issues throughout the night."}

Despite the 1.5 panicked hours waiting for the UPS driver after the guaranteed delivery time, I was very pleased with this dress. The color is more vibrant than how it appears in the photos online; it is very well made; and the fabric is lightweight and floaty. Moving around the ballroom and dance floor were effortless, and twirling in the skirt was fun. The waistline was snug in the right way - not too tight - and there were no issues with the zipper. The length was perfect for me. I'm 5'2\" on a good day so hem length is always a challenge. I was able to wear 3\" heels with the dress and not trip over the hem AND my shoes were appropriately covered. I wore delicate gold drop earrings with pave diamonds, a delicate gold cage ring with pave diamonds and a simple gold bracelet.  "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress is a lot of fun and gets a lot of attention! I purchased my first Nubra for this dress, and it worked out great. There is no support in the dress, so busty girls won't be able to go braless. Even though the dress is fabulous, I didn't feel as confident as I normally do in my RTR dresses. The design is not best suited for curvy, hourglass, or pear-shapes because the skirt is rather slim. I still wore my usual size, 0, instead of going up a size because the shoulders fit best on the 0, and that was more important for the dress to work. The fabric is rather thin and delicate, but fortunately the print hides any imperfections you may feel insecure about. Of course, you must feel rather confident about your back! While dancing the already short skirt rides up, and the shoulders can fall off. I wore it J.Crew hot pink suede almond-toe pumps and no other accessories. "}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "This was a new item so there were no reviews to go by. In my experience, Australian brands have run small so I ordered a size 6R to test out. It was HUGE! I then rented a 4R, with a 2R as a back up. The 4R was a bit loose in the waist and hips (unusual for me) so I squeezed into the 2R and it was bangin'. The only downside was my bust was on a perilous edge of spilling out all night. For bigger busts, you do need a strapless bra,  otherwise the top pancakes you. The slit in the top dips really low, so you need a u shaped strapless or get creative with what you have. The dress was super uncomfortable because the top was constricting yet I had to keep tugging it up. The sequins also kept scratching the underside of my arms. The hip area offers enough give that you can sit and bend very comfortably though. It was worth it for the 1920's over the top event we went to. I'd suggest for a New Year's Event or something sexy but don't wear to a wedding because it's too showy. "}

The 8 had a bit more room to give for eating and it did move up and down my body throughout the night. I was fine with that though.  I was able to wear a bra that has sticky sides and it didn't show at all. I wore spanx but with no underwear because that would have shown through, the seam of the spanx did show a little.

It was also a touch long- I wore 4\" heels and I still felt like I needed to be a little mindful that I didn't step all over it when walking around, but no issues with dancing in it at all.

I tried on the 4 and it was baggy and unflattering and I was heart broken, but when I tried on the 2 it fit perfectly! It was a little tight in the chest area, but otherwise absolutely amazing. My date was 6'8\" and I decided to wear 5 inch heels so the 2L was the perfect length. There's a nude almost sheer layer of fabric in between the lace in the back and my actual skin so I was able to get away with wearing a strapless nude bra. Everyone loved my dress!

The large fit well though like others have said the zipper is hard to manage over the different fabric in the middle but after a few attempts I got the hang of it. I got more used to it.

I ordered a size 2 and 4 as back up. The 2 was a bit too big but I was able to pull it off. The back is low and there is a mesh area in the front so you need to have sticky boobs as a bra. I loved this dress!!! "}

The dress arrived on the day that it was expected and shipping it back was a breeze!"}

I still loved it though. The 6 long would have been perfect, but I didn't have that size.  Bust area was a little \"revealing\" for me, but it was fine."}

I went with the medium because I have a larger bust. Overall, I would definitely rent this dress again!"}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress is everything that you could ever want for a black tie formal event. The fit is amazing, it just screams classy with a hint of sexy, and is so easy to style. RTR was only able to send me the 6 instead of the 8 and I was in a panic thinking it wouldn't fit as I'm a bit curvier, BUT it totally fit! I have a bigger chest so that was a bit snug but nothing worth complaining about! It was just such a perfect dress, I recommend it to anyone who wants to stand out!"}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "I absolutely loved the design and drape of this dress. I sized up a size since the dress was tight in the bust area and the fabric doesn't stretch. The straps at the shoulder/neck area were very tight and rubbed all night - a little extra strap length would've fixed this issue. Other than that, I loved EVERYTHING about this dress and got compliments throughout the evening!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The fit was a little big on top, but that's because I'm on the shorter side and have a shorter torso. That being said, I was extremely comfortable!

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "The dress is made of a heavier and more durable material. When it falls to your feet, it has a beautiful, flowy look - almost like ripples/waves at your feet.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "The color of this dress is a stunning, eye-catching royal blue. The style is simple, but classic, and the slits give it a slight edge without being overwhelming or distracting. My favorite aspect of this dress was the fit, which was perfection for my pear-shape build. The dress hugged every curve, highlighting my slim waist and contouring my hips and bum. Overall, I really enjoyed this dress and would considering wearing it again!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I ordered this dress as a backup, and I ended up wearing it because I fell in love with it! It was so flattering while still being classy and not too revealing. The back is also gorgeous, although the dress arrived with some damage to the lace near the hook at the top of the zipper. Although, the lace was dark so you could not tell there was any damage. \n\nAgain, loved this dress and would highly recommend it!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The Gold Floral Printed Midi Dress is a great formal affair option! Nicole Miller provided the perfect element of surprise with the mesh detail. Running true to size with a side zipper, we recommend sizing up for your backup. A strapless bra  is best for A - C cup sizes. The fabric has a little stretch in the chest and hits about tea length. Pair with a great necklace and heels for the night out!"}

{"fit": "small", "rating": 3, "review": "I really enjoyed this dress. It's so classic, in the best way possible. I am usually a 6 but I had to size up to my size 8 backup, the waist is very tight and does not stretches at all due to the embroidered waistband. When I sized up (because of the waist area) the bust became a bit too large and was bulging in weird places. Nothing dramatic, but I had to wear something to cover my sides and back. Otherwise, pockets are great as always. Lengthwise I am 5' 7\" and the 8L could have been a little bit longer with 4\" heels."}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "I straddle the 4/6 sizes and this fit me perfectly in a size with no gaping on top so I would suggest sizing down.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I wore this dress to an elegant beach wedding in Puerto Vallarta. The dress is beautiful and was perfect for the occasion. A few reviewers mentioned that the corset inside the dress was uncomfortable. This was the case for me too. In a few spots, the boning of the corset was uncomfortable, especially when dancing. I fixed this by going to the restroom to wadding up tissue to put it against those spots. I managed but it was a bit of a hassle. Bottom line: Beautiful dress and I received lots of compliments. If you wear it be prepared for the corset to possibly poke you in places."}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress is amazing! It runs small, size up with this dress. If you are small on top, I recommend wearing a sticky, gel backless bra to provide coverage and a lift. Also, the arms are small and tight.

I got more compliments in this dress than I have wearing any other dress. Enjoy!"}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 3, "review": "Beautiful dress but this particular one seemed a little tattered.  Im not quite sure what happened but the bust area on both were stretched out and even though I sized down I kept pulling to up.  The boning on the side also jabbed into my skin."}

Things to think about: it runs small (which is great for me because I usually wear a 0 or 00 petite) and the neck is snug (but it didn't bother me).

I am 5'6 and the length was long which I prefer. It hit the floor w/4 inch heels. I got compliments everywhere I turned and I felt truly gorgeous in this dress. It was a very formal affair and I stood out among the many all black dresses. The cut is low so if you have boobs be aware. I wear a 34 C and I am a full C. I was able to wear a regular bra underneath which is a HUGE selling point for me, but as you can see from these pics, cleavage cannot be avoided. I would absolutely rent this again and if you want a stand out/knock out and classy dress this is your pick!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I LOVED this dress and so did everyone else.  Beautiful, light fabric.  The asymmetrical cut and floral fabric underneath are a beautiful touch.

It was a actually a little long on me, even wearing 3 inch heels (I am 5'2\"), and it was raining which was a bummer, but I would just gather it up when walking outside and it was fine. Also! I am a person who is ok with low cut tops, and wear a 32D bra, and this was very revealing - I had to safety pin it closed, and it still sort of gaped open when I was sitting. Nothing wrong with that, just something to be aware of. Double sided tape may help too!"}

I would definitely recommend this dress!!"}

Had to wear a strapless bra which I was slightly bummed about but that went fine. had several compliments on the dress and did not hesitate telling people that it was rented! "}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "I rented this dress for one of the formal nights on a cruise to Alaska. The size 6R was way too small - and the top clasp on the right shoulder was missing. I was lucky the 6 did not fit because I did have time to have the clasp repaired and the dress cannot be worn without it. The size 8L fit well, but was long and dragged a bit on the floor, which was not convenient on a rocking ship. Other than these minor issues, the dress was gorgeous, comfortable, and I got compliments on it all night long. It provides full coverage, and I did not need to wear a bra. You will love this dress!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress was amazing! The fabric was thicker and had a double-lining, making it super comfortable and not at all scratchy despite being \"sparkly\" on top. I would definitely own this dress if I could. It's a great winter option, especially if you tend to get cold like I do! The back of the dress also has a bit of a criss-cross with the fabric which is a nice added detail that I didn't really notice in the pictures online. I went with a size 0, but ordered the 2 as a backup. The material was stretchy enough that the 0 worked great and wasn't too tight. It was a little difficult to get on just because of the cut so I would recommend putting it on before getting your hair up. Overall it was a fantastic dress and my husband loved it! Would definitely wear this again if given the chance! "}

It made a cute weekend outfit with light wash jeans, espadrilles and an orange  bag that matched the embroidery.  "}

Yes, it holds you in as others have commented but we went out for a huge Italian dinner at the beginning of the evening and I definitely needed to consciously suck it in for photos. :)  In order to emphasize the level of tightness this dress truly is, there is one picture from the evening taken at an angle so that you could clearly see the seam on the front of my tights...yikes!"}

For whatever reason, wear and tear, not too sure.. the lace detail on the top ( sleeves and around the neck area) as well as the lace detail on the bottom edge of the dress was hemmed off completely. This made the dress completely different than what is shown. Not only that, but the backup size had all the lace detailing so  it was really obvious when looking at them side by side how different the dresses were. Needless to say, the one that was missing all the lace detail (size 6) was the one that fit. I was tempted to call RTR but at the end of the day, the dress looked fine and fit properly.

At 5'7\", I fall between the regular and tall length, but went with regular.  It was right on the border of being too short.  I paired the dress with a chunk necklace for maximum effect.  Overall I felt wonderful and had a great experience wearing this dress."}

It is made of a thick stretch fabric that hugs the body (regardless of shape, as I am a curvy girl) in all of the right places. I would buy this dress if I had the money. There is just a bit of rouging in the tummy area to cover any problem areas. There is rouging at the base of the zipper on the back that extenuates the butt beautifully. I was worried about this feature as I have plenty of booty, but it wrapped my curves and extenuated them in a classy, beautiful way. Did I say, I LOVE THIS DRESS? I felt like a bombshell!  "}

Since I'm tall (5'8\") I think the sleeves were a bit short on me, but that wouldn't be an issue for someone shorter. The style was very cool, and I liked the high neck and bell sleeves, but I do think it confused my boyfriend a little bit ;) Definitely a nice choice for a winter-time formal event. Keeps you warm and looks good!"}

Yes, the dress runs slightly small in the bodice area. For reference though, I'm very much straight from chest to hip and any dress with something resembling a waist line normally gives me some trouble. The 2 would've probably been fine, but I planned on eating a big dinner and didn't want to be uncomfortable. \nThe dress itself has beautiful gold detailing and I love the lining of the skirt with a glimmer that peaks out when you move. I'm 5'8\" and the length was perfect to be flirty without dangerous. Very flattering (particularly with the waist area). I'm small busted and did not end up needing a bra. Compliments all night! I had a total stranger stop me in the ladies' room to remark on the dress. It would also be appropriate for a formal wedding or business affair particularly if glammed up with some accessories. Definitely recommend!"}

I typically wear a size 6 in dresses and wore an 8 in this, though it was tight and I probably would have been more comfortable in a 10.  The color is beautiful and much more vibrant than online, and it has a more defined waist than it appears to which I appreciated. One thing to note is if you are pear shaped you will find this dress hard to fit, I have a 34B chest and wider hips and though it was tight through the bottom it was loose on top, I needed to wear a heavily padded strapless bra (Victoria's Secret bombshell) for it to fit right, and I imagine the 10 would have been worse.

It ended up being a little snug, but that probably has more to do with holiday baked goods than the cut of the dress. It fit like a glove, and although it was a little challenging to sit down, otherwise it was very comfortable. The long length was great. I'm 5'11\" and I was able to wear 2.5\" heels without the dress looking short.

It was a gorgeous day, so the majority of the time, I was outside. I didn't notice much difference between the S and the M, so I wore the S. Overall it was comfortable and casual enough for my event. The length was an inch or two above my knee, which was fine. I wore a tank top underneath to avoid exposing too much up top. This dress made me realize I'm not a huge fan of true wrap dresses. I'm not sure I tied this one correctly, since it came untied and with no instructions, so it came untied a few times during the day. I also had to be super careful getting up from sitting at the picnic table as the opening of the wrap liked to fall right between my legs and fly open as I was getting up. Overall, I'm happy I chose this dress to celebrate in and would consider renting it again for a casual event."}

The cut of the dress is definitely not sexy by any means, but if you are attending an event that requires you to look classy not trashy it works. The cheetah print helps to spice it up a little.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "It fit like a glove. I was a little nervous because I seriously thought that you'd be able to see my pooch and that my arms would look huge, but this dress has such a flattering neckline and the fabric/weight of the fabric doesn't allow everything to be on display. There's obviously a second layer underneath that acts like a slip. The only caveat that I had was that the clasp at the neck would sporadically open - the dress wouldn't fall down or anything, but I would notice that the fit of the neck was all of a sudden loose. I did not wear heels (because I just didn't want to) and the dress came to my toes. You could see my shoes when I was walking but not when I was standing. It has two stunning colors but (full disclosure) the top is a little more hot pink and the bottom is more red than the picture RTR has. 10/10 would rent again"}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "Yah, it runs really large. I'm normally a 4, sometimes 6, and was still swimming in the extra small. If you are maybe a 6-8, the XS would probably work for you. However, if I pulled the shoulders up so it's not an off-the-shoulder, that helped a little with the oversize-ness in the bust area. Then I belted it and that helped contain some of the fabric below.  It was actually pretty cute that way for a date night!"}

I was worried about the length because most reviews said get long but I wore 3 inch heels and at 5'6\" the length was fine. I wore nude pointed heels and they were great. Taking the outfit off for the bathroom was easy as well!! I would DEFIN rent again - the compliments were endless.

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "When I first put this dress on,  I honestly wasn't sure about. The fit seemed off to me,  a little loose around my butt and stomach and the breast cups were horribly pointy. The bottom tulle is also a bit poofier than it looks in the picture. In the picture it also looks more gold and creamish, when it is actually a more gold and light beige-ish, though that wasn't a big deal.  I almost traded the size O for a 4 and am very glad I didn't as even the extra size 2 I had gotten was way too loose. \n\nBUT, I figured out that if I stuck a bra in between the part that held the cups up and the fabric the nipple pointyness went away.  With that gone the other unsureties seemed moot.  Once I had the whole ensemble together; hair,  makeup,  accessories,  this dress was absolutely GORGEOUS. The fit now seemed fantastic. The top part fit beautifully,  accentuating my petite hour glass shape and really making my breasts look great too. A lot of strapless gowns will have all that extra space,  but this one really hugged me and even gave me a little modest cleavage.  The fabric, color, and design is high quality and beautiful.  I am not exaggerating when I say I really had the most beautiful dress there.  I received several compliments,  and caught even more looking. \n\nI was really sad to take this dress off,  and even more sad to send it away.  I would love to own this dress. "}

Be warned, however, that these are women's sizes and they run larger than usual.  The dress was cut to show off your curves, so it's needs to fit well.  It was a flattering cut but  the 14W was too large for me.  I could have gone a size smaller (or regular 14).  Also note that it has a large, visible zipper in the back that runs to the hemline.  In my opinion, it made the dress a bit more casual.  Would definitely consider it again in a different size."}

The only reason why this isn't 5 stars is because it runs SMALL! I ended up wearing the small instead of the XS because it is so short in the back that you'll see cheeks! Considering I'm typically a petite 00 or XXS on everything I buy (usually because I have a tiny butt), I couldn't believe that I had to wear a size small. So beware on that and I recommend that you size 1 and even 2 times bigger than usual. Besides that, it's gorgeous!"}

I would definitely rent this dress again in the future!!!"}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "I usually wear a 4 but this was too baggy, so a size down to a 2 was more ideal. The button on the back was very hard to clasp together, and I spent more time getting in and out of the blouse than I would prefer. Aside from that, it's a beautiful top. It is very sheer, so either wear a cami or a black bandeau bra underneath."}

I usually am a 4 or 6 in Free People so I'm glad I opted for the smaller of the two. \nOddly though, the straps were a bit long though I am tall (5'9). But it didn't prove to be too much of an issue as the dress stayed fit in the midsection. The midsection is actually rather tight and not stretchy so be aware if you are wide in the ribs this may be uncomfortable. "}

The entire experience was relatively low stress from placing the order, changing the delivery date online, interacting with customer service to tracking my return. First, I have to say this was my backup dress and suggested by my stylist.  I fell in love with the dress the moment  I saw it. I had originally ordered the BM Screen Siren dress but due to problems with the zipper (I couldn't get it to zip up all the way). I called customer service in a panic and requested a size exchange. I also wanted another dress\" just in case\". My stylist was Reylisa and she worked with me patiently to pick another dress.  I got this dress in the 14R which was the shortest they had for my 5'1\" frame.  There was still a bit of fabric pooled on the floor, and I held the dress up while walking and dancing. My heels were about 3 inches. The dress was very comfortable and easy to dance in. The ruching camouflages the midsection. I didn't find myself  pulling it up too often. There was no chafing from the sequins under my  arms. I also paired it with the GOLD SANSKRIT CUFF from RTR."}

I ordered both the 10R and the 12R as my back up size, but ended up wearing the 12R because there was a little bit more breathing room and the length worked better with my 3 1/2 inch heels. The only con I had was that the straps were too long and kept falling off of my shoulders if I slouched even a little. I do, however, have an extremely short torso, so this is commonly a problem I have with any dress I try on. Anyone with a normal length torso shouldn't have this same problem. Otherwise, the dress was fabulous, and I would totally wear it again! "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore this dress to my last Law Prom. I was really hesitant at first because of the pattern and how bright it was, but I am SO GLAD I ordered this dress. Overall- this is one of the best dresses I have ever rented from RTR and I wish I could keep it. Its a fun party dress or cocktail dress with an amazing, bright pattern. The length was also just right- a little bit above the knee (which is what I prefer). The material was perfect- very structured and thick, similar to a bandage dress. The lining underneath at first was hard to keep from going below the dress, but a very adjustments before I left prevented the lining from peeking down. I did not wear a bra with the dress because I felt  had enough support and the fabric was thick enough not stop show anything. I did wear a pair of Spanx, just for the overall look of smoothness with the dress, but don't feel like you need to. I ordered the 12 as my back up size and it did and it was not as tight as the 10, but did not wear it. With the 12, the straps were loose and falling off my shoulders and did not fully hold up my breasts, which would have required me to wear a bra. You cannot wear a bra in this dress unless you have a very low demi cup and some fashion tape to make sure it doesn't rise above the neck line. "}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "Loved the neckline on this dress! I rented the 4 and the 6. The 4 fit a little better, but I probably could have fit into a 2 as well.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I definitely loved the color of the dress. It was form fitting, but had a fun skirt. I felt very comfortable in the dress, it was easy to wear and had pockets! I didn't like the lining underneath, it did poke out of the sleeves a lot, but it was easy enough to fix throughout the night. I thought the arms were tight like others said, but not enough to make it uncomfortable. It is a thick dress! It was much heavier than I expected, so if you want to dance the night away this might not be the dress for you! If I wore it again, I would've added a necklace."}

It was a little long on me (I'm 5'0'') but it was really easy to tack up with some hemming tape.  I was worried about dancing in it, so I didn't want to wear too high of a heel. I went with my ivory peep toe wedding shoes that have a 2.5 inch heel and was fine all night!  It's a great, fun dress!!!! And came in perfect condition!! "}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "I rented this dress for a black-tie optional gala in DC. This dress was the perfect spin on the typical LBD, with unique and modern elements that made it stand out. The long sleeves combined with the short skirt made it very appropriate for the season and occasion. The skirt is a great length - not too short, not too long. It comes lined with a cool structured slip that maintains the flare shape on the skirt. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the waist on this dress runs really small so I highly recommend sizing up one or two sizes, especially if you have a larger waist/rib cage. I'm typically a size 8-10 and I wore a 12 in this dress. The waist has absolutely no stretch so you want to make sure you have a size you'll be able to get zipped up.

The front of the dress came off the floor slightly when I stood up straight, so I would recommend a 3\" heel to future 5'5\" renters.

It was tighter in the butt (I'm a little curvier here), but lots of room in stomach, good eating dress. :) I have a longer torso too, but it wears just fine. I wore it to a wedding that was Kentucky Derby theme style and it fit perfectly. \nI'm not usually a pink dress person, but it was too beautiful to resist. The dress is a almost coral color in real life while the picture makes it seem more light pink. When I initially took it out of the box, I was almost disappointed because I thought it was too pink, but it really wasn't, I just am not used to wearing pink. \nThe design of the dress is great AND it has pockets, which I couldn't tell from the picture. Pockets in any dress is a huge plus!! The dress felt very classic, feminine, and romantic. Loved this dress and would definitely recommend it to anyone."}

The 0 fit me perfect but since I'm 5'3 the dress ran long so I got 3 inch heels and it was barely touching the floor. I felt so fabulous and beautiful the whole time, this is a dress girl must rent! I also want to add its more of a blush/champagne color then it just being a champagne color dress and I was so happy the dress came with fashion tape as well. I truly got what I paid for!

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This is a great dress to wear to a wedding, where you want to be fancy, but still pretty and floral. I'm 5'8\" and the length in the back was just above the floor when I wasn't wearing shoes.  Though the sizing was accurate, I will say that the bodice has no give, and so it can create a bit of the \"armpit rolls\" problem. Accordingly, I'd size up for the alternate."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 3, "review": "I got this as a backup dress when I discovered that my first pick was no longer available in the second size. I wanted to love this but it really didn't work for me. The waist goes down on both sides of the hips, which wasn't very flattering on my hourglass figure and made my hips look large. The straps were also way too long. \n\nOther than that I liked the fabric and the color of the dress, my friend ended up wearing it for the wedding instead and she looked great, she has much narrower hips so it gave her the illusion of hips instead of flaring out too much like it did on me."}

I had no problems what so ever, I ordered the large and x large because it had mixed reviews on true to size and runs large. Usually with having a huge bust area it's hard to find dresses that fit but the large fit perfectly and I could wear the large with no bra as well as the x large, I definitely liked both sizes and wore both! If you're usually in between with size and bust area  I'd definitely go with both large sizes, it was super comfortable and the fabric was very lightweight. Also keep in mind I'm a Double F and the large fit but did fit a little snug in the large but overall was great! "}

I tried the 16W on in the store but wore the 18W for my birthday brunch to give me a little more room for all the delicious food we had LOL! I wish I had worn the 16W instead though because I think the more snug fit looked better overall. Anyhoo, I really felt beautiful in this dress and loved that it showed my legs (I'm told I have nice ones (wink) ) without being too short. I love the flounce style as well. Would definitely rent again. I paired with gold wedge heels and aquas/greens/gold jewelry and accessories."}

The dress was gorgeous and everything I hoped it would be!  I received so many compliments!  Very flattering dress!  The only negative is the sequins are a bit rough, and did rub on my underarms.  Will defiantly be renting again! "}

It was a tiny bit long in the back, but I was still comfortable walking around and dancing. My husband thought it was really cool that the dress flowed out like a cape as I walked. I did have to pin the shoulders up about a half inch, but it was easy to do and the dress looked great. I can't wait to rent another!\nPS - Don't forget about the pockets. I discovered them at the very end of the night and was sad I didn't get the full use of them :) "}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 3, "review": "This dress is made for women with smaller chests. Normally I wear a size 8 and have comfortable room in the bust (I'm a 34DDD); however this dress completely smashed in my chest. but fit well around my waist. The size 10 was still too tight in the chest and a little too loose in the waist, but I made due since I had no other options. Also, although the notes say you can wear a standard bra, you actually can't unless you don't mind your bra showing. The dress is cut in at the arm opening so I had to pin my bra straps so they wouldn't constantly show. The side of my bra could also be seen from the bottom of the arm holes, but once again, I just had to make due. \nI will say the dress is a great color and I did receive many compliments throughout the night, so I guess no one else noticed the issues I had with it."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress is stunning! I received so many compliments the entire night. I am normally in between the sizes 2 and 4 depending on the cut of the dress. I have a small bust and slightly wider hips, so this dress fit me perfectly in the size 2. I agree with the previous comments about the inner lining of the skirt lying awkwardly and feeling scratchy against your legs. Additionally, the boning of the bodice poked through the material and into my side. Other than that, I am very happy with my RTR."}

The grommets make it a little edgier of a piece so it's perfect for a business casual work environment."}

I wore it with turquoise jewelry and nude pumps. Very happy with the way it turned out. The only downfall is that it was very loose around the waist and its longer than the picture depicts (came to just above my knee). I was able to use sticky tape in the back to make it look a little more fitted in the front. And with a higher heel the dress didn't look too long. Overall I was very happy with the dress and received a lot of compliments!"}

I paired it with black tights and either black boots or black lace-up flats. I didn't have any problem with the neck being too low (32/34G - perhaps a smaller or different shaped bust would bring the V uncomfortably low?). The thick, stretchy fabric was SO comfortable and the length was fine for me with tights; I probably wouldn't wear this length to work without opaque tights. Living in Texas, I wouldn't rent this dress for much longer this year - the long sleeves don't easily push up so I recommend for cooler environments!"}

Shipping was prompt and even included some travel size goodies! Love this company and definitely will rent again."}

The cut and the pleated skirt allow for more freedom of movement in the lower half, especially in the hip, which allowed me to wear my normal size 16W. I was worried that the torso wouldn't be high enough for my small bump since it hits at the natural waist, but this was actually fine. I was truly comfortable and happy all day, and everyone complimented the dress the whole afternoon.

The 0 fit perfectly through my chest and body, but had a little extra room vertically in the shoulders (typically that would be a petite adjustment) and a lot of extra fabric on the hem. I'm 5'0\" and heels don't exist that would make me tall enough for this dress! Luckily the fabric is very forgiving and with a quick needle and thread I was able to make a loose and removable, but invisible, hem. I would recommend this dress to anyone attending a black tie event, just be weary if you're under 5'2\". You may need super tall heels or a removable hem!"}

The fit is extremely forgiving and I didn't worry about my curves at all, even though I had twins last year. On the other hand, it felt a little bit matronly at times because it really accents instead of minimizing the hips.\n\nI'm not especially busty (34C), but this dress would look more amazing on someone with a fuller chest. I wore a normal (but plunging) bra and I did have to use a lot of fashion tape to secure it."}

You can wear a regular strapped bra with it. The sleeves sat up fine. It is very sexy & fun to wear."}

The structuring is so well done that it didn't keep slipping down like most strapless dresses do on me.  If you're 5'8\" or over, you need a long, I had on killer queen four and a half inch heels and even the long size was a tad short.

My mother-in-law thought it looked black and thought I should wear black shoes and a black jacket with it opposed to the nude color shoes and khaki coat I wore (not shown in pictures). This was my favorite Rent the Runway experience to date. I rented this from my home in Union City, CA and received it on time in the Chicagoland area where my husband's family resides."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress was adorable. Pros: great for someone with a larger bust. I'm a 34dd and I was able to wear a backless dress for the first time! I had to use an adhesive backless bra. Most of the time adhesive bras can't handle a DD and it turns out badly in the end. Because this dress comes up high on your neck and you tie the bow in the back it helps everything stay secure.  It fit perfectly around my waist and was a great length. The only con is I have to return it! "}

It is the exact amount of flash, sexy, and chic you're looking for.  The fit was fine.  The back was very low, so you can't wear a traditional bra.  I didn't wear one at all and felt fine all night."}

I was unsure of how it would look on me because I look nothing like the model. But when I tried the dress on, it was so comfortable\u2013loose, flowy, lightweight, and ethereal. The color gradient is really beautiful in person. The only problems I had were that the zipper got stuck on the waistband, and I absolutely could not zip it up myself, and the sides of the bodice were slightly baggy and looked kind of bad in photos. I got compliments nonstop all night. I was a little nervous about how low-cut it is (and I definitely got some looks in that direction), but I was able to dance all night with no major concerns. I might recommend some fashion tape if you're worried about showing too much skin."}

It fit true to size, maybe just a little on the small side but had stretch to it so it was surprisingly comfortable.  My normal size is 10-12 (I have a smaller waist and wider hips) and after reading the reviews to go a size up I ordered a 12 and a 14.  The 12 fit perfectly and the 14 was way too big.  I was with work colleagues and didn't want to show cleavage but the draped back gave it enough pizzazz that the dress still felt sexy.  I wore it with a gold back necklace.  Great dress and so flattering."}

I wore it with nude pumps. I wished I had the 0 instead of the 2, but I wanted to play it safe. It was very forgiving through the hips, more so than I expected, so I could've sized down for a more flattering fit through the waist. Either way, very elegant and easy piece and would work great if you are renting while out of town. Can't really go wrong with it.\nThanks RTR"}

With no stretch to the fabric and a tighter fit in the top area, this piece is best for A-C cup sizes. This style is fitted at waist and natural waist, but comfortable at the hips. With this backless style, it's best to wear no bra, or the NuBra. I'm 5'5\" and wearing 3 inch heels, so the Regular length just touched the floor. "}

The chest was a bit loose, but I wore a padded bra and it made it snug enough to fill in the dress and keep the bra in place all night, which was great since I didn't have to tug at it at all. I thought the dress a little plain, so I wore a black belt with black and gold jewelry, and bright red lipstick to match the dress.  I like how it looked and was sad to drop it back in the mail.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress was very nice and light to put on! I wish there was a little bit of give at the waist, but there's a ton of space below so it oddly enough didn't feel too restrictive. When I did sit down, it was a little tight, but it wasn't unbearable. The dress is very long at the back, so I wearing 4.5\" to 5\" heels in absolutely required. The zipper in the back is VERY LONG. which is excellent given the tighter fit with the natural waist part of the dress. Because the waist was a tighter fit, to make my life easier, I put on the dress backwards, zipped it up, and then rotate the dress back and then put the clasp on it. The clasp in the back is notably big! So clipping that on is pretty easy. Overall a great rental and dress for the event."}

The peplum skirt is figure flattering and it is a classic dress with unlimited accessory options."}

I wore minimal jewelry since the dress speaks for itself and the color was bold/regal enough to make a statement. Some advice for those who are small chested like me, make sure you buy double-sided tape.

The 4 was a little tight, so I went with the 6 for comfort but overall not a huge swing in size.

The chest panel and lining under the skirt are a pale blue color, which contrasts nicely with the burgundy. The quality of the dress is very nice and the skirt sort of flounces out all on its own. I had so many compliments, and I literally wish I had an excuse to wear it every single day. "}

I'm a 34DD (by Victoria's Secret standards) and the size 6 dress fit perfectly without making me feel like I was suffocating. I'm 5'3 and was concerned that I would be swimming in the dress but turns out that the Petite size is 3 inches shorter than the regular, which worked out great with my 3 inch heels. Even when I swapped my heels out for flats, I still didn't feel like the dress was going to make me fall on my face. I HIGHLY recommend this dress (and RTR in general) for all of your dress needs. I am so happy that I rented this dress, it made me look and feel like a million bucks."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The dress did fit true-to-size, which was amazing (especially because my backup size wasn't available). I have a large bust and wider hips so sometimes these dresses' fit can be a challenge, but this one wasn't too tight in the arms, bust, OR waist. The material is thick and very comfortable (although, the underlining WAS torn when I received the dress; I hope RTR is able to fix the tear). The length was good on my frame. The pleats in the skirt are a little strange, but not unflattering. Best part? THE POCKETS."}

The girl I spoke with (I think Rachel/Chelsea?) said she could see if the dresses I had ordered were available for an overnight shipment so I could receive the dresses Saturday afternoon for my event.  One of the dresses I originally ordered was available but one was not.  So I ordered this one as a back up.  I LOVED IT!!!  It was beautiful and elegant and even got the \"Wow, babe!\" from the bf.  It was a little big on me in the waist/hips and I probably could have worn a 2R but was happy with the 4R.  They also sent the clutch I ordered in the overnight shipment and I was not charged extra for the overnight.  "}

With the help of my hubby we got it zipped and once it was on... I've never felt so confident in a dress before. The structure of the dress is so that I was able to go without a bra and spanks- fabric is thick but super breathable and beyond comfortable all night. Although it is tight at the top, I didnt have to adjust it at all throughout the evening and felt great! I would HIGHLY recommend this dress but definitely get a backup size larger. I was unable to as it was sold out, but the 2R fit perfectly! Will definitely be renting/ buying this in the future."}

Dress is great for sitting and eating and dancing.  It rose about 2 inches above the knee. I would have preferred it to be another 2 inches shorter for it to feel fun and flirty without being too sexy.  Not sure how it would look on shorter women without massive heels. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This was my first RTR rental and to sum it up in one word: Priceless.   This dress was everything I was looking for.  I wanted something that really made a statement, and it did just that and more.  The compliments were endless and the feeling while wearing the dress was that of confidence and true beauty.  I felt like a million bucks!  unfortunately though, I did not receive a second size in the dress perhaps due to high demand however, I was lucky that the size 4 fit like a glove and worked with my figure so nicely.  I didn't want to leave off a star for not getting the second dress because I ordered it 2 days before the event so, I ran the risk of the 2nd size being out of stock.  In conclusion, If you wanna make a statement, turn some heads and really feel great in a dress, RENT THIS ONE!!  The sequins are so small and elegantly detailed with a unique design.  Do not be afraid of the sparkles.  I would DEFINITELY rent this one again to another event, I love it! THANK YOU RTR!!!!!!!"}

It is a gorgeous dress -- very simple style, but the color and cut in the back make it stand out effortlessly. It is, at once, very flattering but also very unforgiving, specifically the midsection. The fabric does not hide anything and the low cut in the back makes spanx or anything else ineffective. Do your crunches and this dress will be perfect!"}

All is all, it's a fun dress, in a lovely color, and I can see this style being flattering on a lot of different shapes. Would definitely rent again!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress has a classy print and fit very well. Definitely true to size. It doesn't have a slit on the back of the skirt and the fabric doesn't stretch much so wider hip ladies may need to go a size up to get the dress on. My hips are much wider than my waist and I had to wiggle a little to get into this dress! But one it was on, it looked great. Also, for short ladies with a short torso, the V neck will be a bit low and you will show cleavage (you can't tell at all from the pic on the site). I wore it to an after work function and got many compliments. I wouldn't have worn it all day to work due to the cleavage situation but taller people won't have this issue. "}

I chose this dress for the bold purple-blue color and it was perfect. The cut of the dress was flattering and fit true to size, however, the cap sleeves seemed much smaller on me than in the picture. They made the dress hard to dance in and that was all I was doing. The sleeves kept bunching up. The material was nice, kind of thick for a summer event though and it was the kind of fabric in which water or condensation from your drink glass will temporarily leave a mark.

Ok, so there's a little bit of a visible bra strap issue as you can see in my picture, but given the overwhelming positives, I'm giving that a pass (also I don't happen to care). One thing to note is that the dress is unlined, though not at all see-through, so it might start getting chilly when autumn sets in (though I have a moto jacket that's a perfect match). Two thumbs way way up!"}

The material is sturdy, and the dress didn't shift/stayed in place all night.

First, it came down to just above my knees, not mid-thigh like in the picture. Also, it seems to be tapered. I definitely experienced the same problem other reviews had, where it restricts movement. There's no way I could pose my legs like the model does in the picture. Also, for a sheath dress, it was incredibly fitted. If I wanted a fitted dress, I would have ordered one. \n\nOverall, I was unimpressed. I don't think going up a size would have helped, either.

It makes it perfectly feminine and fun.The lace and fabric details are beautiful. My one complaint it there is a separate black slip underneath which wasn't my favorite.

I'm a very true size 6 (or so I thought) but couldn't breathe in the 6 because of the waistband. Once I got the 8, it was impossible to zip up - not because it didn't fit, but the zipper wouldn't go over the beaded band. I sat and played with it and with the help of two friends, we got it on! It was a little big under my arms, but nothing I couldn't deal with. It was SO worth the effort. I loved the dress and got so many compliments. It also has pockets - woo! I also had to get the long, and I'm 5'6 but it was perfect for my 4\" heels. "}

It was very fitted on the top, tight on the boobs, but a little loose on my shoulders. LOVED the pockets and overall color, pattern and length.

I would definitely endorse this dress for anyone who wants a classic look but knows classic doesn't have to mean boring. \n\nThe fit runs true to size, though the top had a good bit more room than I personally needed - which made the straps hang a bit loose in the back. Though some reviews have said that this dress required going braless or wearing a NuBra, I was able to wear a standard bra that has a back that falls low.  (I also used fashion tape to help secure the straps to my shoulders since they were a bit loose on me.) \n\nAll in all, this was a great dress!"}

I could have worn the size two and it would have looked equally as good as the size zero. I prefered the size 0 due to not being able to wear a bra with this dress. I just didn't have a bra that worked with the cutouts. I love the color, design, and fit of this dress. It is one of the thicker Elizabeth and James dresses, which I appreciate. I highly recommend this dress!"}

Perfect length, too. It was also surprisingly comfortable (I was able to dance all night in it!). The dress is even prettier in person--amazing color and fabric was thick, but breathable. Great for spring/fall."}

The dress cuts off at a great part of your mid section, making your waist look small but hiding all the unwanted squish.

The fit was very flattering and it felt feminine and flowy even on a hot South Carolina summer day.  I think that you could easily dress this up or down, which is also a plus.  \n\nUpdate: I did rent this for a 'black tie optional' event, and dressed it up a bit more than when I wore it to the wedding.  I had several compliments throughout the night.  I still love the dress, but was disappointed that the one I was sent was missing the belt.  You wouldn't notice it if you weren't looking, and the dress looked good anyway, I just liked the added touch of the belt."}

I only wore it for my photoshoot and not an actual event but nonetheless, it was very comfortable the entire 3 hrs during the shoot. The material is quite thick and heavy so it's perfect for winter events! The pockets in the dress made for posing so easy and comfortable. A few downsides however... The neckline isn't the most flattering. It's hard to wear a bra with it so the chest area just looks really flat with a lowcut v which was sorta weird. The tapered ribcage area was a little bit boxy looking and since it had no give, it just hid my hourglass waist which was a bit unfortunate. But overall, great dress and great quality. Will definitely be renting from RTR again!"}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 3, "review": "The dress is a beautiful color and a great fabric, but the fit was really unusual. I often have difficult with some clothes since I have a 27inch back but larger boobs so I don't usually comment on fit, but this dress was so off that I imagine well-proportioned people will still have issues. I'm usually a 4/6 and I got this in a 4 and it HUNG off my top half. The straps were way too long that there was serious gaping around my armpits from the excess fabric. To make the dress flattering, I considered pinning back the straps, but to do so sufficiently... I literally had fistfuls of fabric in both hands, I mean seriously who is this designed for? 6ft7 women with ridiculously long torsos?? Plus the skirt section cuts a bit too high, so it's above your hips, giving a bit of an unflattering form. Really hoped I could have worn this since the color was so great. It also was way too long on me, came down to my knees. I know 5\"3 is small but come on... So I definitely would not recommend this for petite ladies!"}

The chest & sleeves stay put from the (not overly) sticky lining and it doesn't bunch up on the body. Thick enough material for an outdoor winter wedding, but I ended up with a jacket that still paired well. Only con was: the hanger straps kept poking out - I was constantly adjusting them back in. If it were mine, I would've cut them off to avoid that issue."}

The 10R was perfect and I got a zillion compliments. \n\nI am 5'4\" and paired the dress with 3.25in heels; the regular length was just long enough. The dress is a bit stretchy and overall fairly forgiving but does cling, especially in the midsection and hip area. I knew that when I ordered it and since I'm 8mos post baby #2 Spanx definitely helped suck everything in. There was still room in the bust area in the 10R and I'm currently fairly busty due to nursing. I was able to wear a regular bra and it did not show at all, even in the back.  The dress was super comfortable, and even though the sequins did rub a bit while dancing it was nothing terrible. I will use RTR again in the future no doubt! "}

I knew I needed a dress (for my sorority sisters wedding) that I could wear my own bra with (strapless with these girls is not an option) and I needed something to hide my tiny postpartum pooch. After reading ALL of the reviews for this particular dress and finding women who \"looked like me\" I decided that this one would best fit my needs and IT EXCEEDED THEM! To say I was \"pleased\" with this dress, earrings, and bracelet is an understatement (yes I rented the jewelry from RTR as well). The packaging, the ease of returning the items, how well the dress fit was amazing. I did have some room in the 16L but because it fit so well in the bust area I didn't bother trying on the 14L. I went with the long for this dress instead of the regular because I knew my heels would give me between 4-5 inches and I didn't want my ankles out. ;) Even when I gave those heels the boot, I wasn't tripping over the gown; Holding up a gown when you walk isn't stressful. The only issue I had was the string holding the middle section together did break so I had to pin the middle again but it wasn't anything major. I would recommend this dress to ALL mothers who want attention to be on their face and not their postpartum love pooch! I can't wait for another event so that I can rent from RTR again! Thank you for helping women feel amazing! "}

The color is most certainly black but it seemed to photograph a little blue at times. The cut of the dress makes it challenging to take on stairs and don't expect to take on the dance floor full throttle. By the end of the night, the weight of the dress and maybe the fabric giving a bit made me feel like I had to pull up the dress a fair amount.

It's absolutely comfortable, and I sometimes forgot I was wearing a formal dress with how easy it was to wear.

The color was perfect for fall and I got a lot of compliments on it throughout the night.

Because of the fabric doing any alterations to the dress are almost impossible, I had a seamstress hand sew a hem in and then the next day take it all out. If you can find a seamstress that will do that and make sure it is in perfect condition then I definitely suggest getting this dress. I am about 5'1 so it was an ideal way to fix the length. Other than that the dress was absolute perfect!   "}

It is not fitted, but the shape is very flattering. I'm usually a size 4/6 more on the 6 side and a 4 worked fine. I probably could have even worn a 2. So, order one or two sizes smaller to make sure you're not swimming in the dress. I would definitely rent this dress again. "}

However, I am short waisted (like 5/2 and there may 4-5 inches between bra line and where my pants hit). I didn't feel like the waist of the dress hit me very well. The asymmetrical part of the dress also photographs very well but I thought it looked strange in person; like it is obviously added on fabric and I wasn't expecting that for some reason. All in all it was a pretty dress but I won't rent it again. "}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress was my back up and wound up being the winner. I'm typically a size 6, went for the 4 and it worked out well. Didn't need much jewelry because the dress was glitzy enough. A bit much for your standard affair but looks amazing on. Slit in the back, top open hole in the back at the top and a button at the top to keep it all together. Flatters your chest. Fits like a glove. Don't have to worry about ironing or wrinkles throughout the night. My bra wound up showing frequently - get boob tape. Extremely flattering all around. "}

It is a great go-to dress, always looks good, frequently appropriate, versatile, comfortable (its lined and has minimal should pads), unforgettable...which I guess is why I rented it...because I had invited everyone in my city circle to my party and I would see them all again at another event where I would not want to wear the same dress.\n\nI highly recommend this dress!!!  Perfect rental investment!"}

The dress has a loose fit, but I will still say its true to size. I wanted to be glamorous and comfortable. This dress was it. The only slight problem occurred when sitting on the restaurant couches. The dress kept riding up and I had to adjust myself a few times. This could really just be a tall girl problem. One thing to note, the sequins are much shinier than they show in pictures. I definitely stood out in the crowd!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This was my first time ever renting a dress from Rent The Runway. At first, I was pretty nervous because the 0 regular wasn't available so I had to order the 0 Long. It ended up being absolutely PERFECT. I paired the dress with 5 inch heels and the length worked out perfectly for me. I would still recommend the regular because without heels, the dress was long and harder to dance in. Despite this, the dress is super comfortable and the fabric is really breathable. I fell in love with it and I never felt so beautiful. I was so sad when I had to return it! Anyways, thank you Rent The Runway!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I usually wear an 8 but sometimes size up to a 10 depending on the style. For this dress the 10 was huge (the sleeves were crazy long!) and it was baggy all over but the 8 fit perfectly (however, the sleeves were still a bit long, I had to roll them up). It was super comfortable and stretchy and the slip underneath was the perfect length to ensure no spanx sightings."}

I was terrified the gown was going to be TOO long, even with my 5 inch heels, and I considered getting a different gown at the last minute, but I am so glad I didn't! The bottom of the dress skimmed the floor perfectly with my heels, and even when I put on flats to dance in, it wasn't overwhelmingly long. I got compliments the entire night, ranging from \"You look like you belong at the Oscars!\" to \"You look like Vanna White!\" This dress is fantastic. The only (and I mean only) downside was the sleeves were a tad restricting, and I couldn't lift my arms terribly high. Even still, this dress was beautiful, and I was so sad I had to send it back! \n\nSide notes: I was able to wear this dress without a bra. I wore nude heels. The dress was a bit more pink-tinted in person. "}

The shirt is the only reason I gave this 4, instead of 5 stars.  It's the same exact color as the top of the leggings, so it's almost too matchy- and the material is weird. Very thin and wide open back. I bet the shirt is great for working out in. Just having the sweatshirt alone was worth the rental, it's amazing. "}

I wore the regular length since I planned on switching into flats that matched the sequins perfectly for the reception.

The lining wasn't tight either and the material is so soft and pretty!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I got so many compliments on this dress! I felt like a princess. The (L) made it long enough for my tall stature. I wore 3 inch heels and the dress still grazed the ground. Also the dress was stretch so you didn't feel constricted. Rent a statement necklace like I did in order to accentuate your neckline. I have a large bust so it was nice to conceal it and draw attention to my shoulders. I would definitely rent this dress again!"}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "At first I was concerned that the 2 would be too large, but with a very tailored (and unforgiving) waistline, the 2 was perfect.  The banded waist really gave this dress shape.  It had a bit of sheen to it, so definitely dressier than every day at the office, but it was perfect to wear to work on an evening when I had a special event after the work day ended.  Color was beautiful, pockets were an added bonus.  Would rent again.  Perfect for an office holiday party or other similarly work to cocktail event."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 2, "review": "This dress was sent to me when the backup size I ordered for a different dress wasn't available. The dress was funky - in a good way - the fabric feels like a scuba suit and the pattern was fun. However, it was too long on my petite frame and hugged my non-existent curves in the wrong places. If you're more shapely and/or on the taller side, this would work great for you. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress is super fun and bright! I am giving the dress 4 stars, because if you're tall like me, you may find the dress a little short (especially because it flares out a bit at the bottom). Despite the length issue (which is not too problematic), it's a beautiful dress! I usually wear a 2 or 4, and the while the 2 fit, I wore the 4 to get some extra length. The dress is very slim through the waist, so it's super flattering. I wore this to my sister-in-law's engagement party and it was great for the event. If you're looking to add some color and pop to your wardrobe, you can't pass this up!"}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress was a beautiful color and I received compliments all night long.  Extremely comfortable and the material had just enough stretch.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "Unique take on a classic dark navy crepe shift... neck tie and shoulder/sleeve details make this standout.  Quality fabric and cut make the dress flattering.

{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore this for a bridal shower I was hosting, and received so many compliments.  The dress is very flattering, and the colors are absolutely stunning in person!  I am between a 6 and an 8 and while I fit into both, the 8 was more comfortable because of the way the sleeves fit.  One caveat though- there was a BO smell under the armpits in both dresses, and I had to do a little febreezing before wearing, so that was a little gross."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This was super cute! I ran into the same fit problem with this dress as I do with most, but that's my body's fault (not the dress's): I have a long torso, so the waistline hits my ribcage instead of my natural waist. The skirt flares out in a cute way, so it didn't look too odd (it just meant that my real waist was hidden underneath the flared skirt and my 'waist' looked wider than it really is -- no biggie!). Sizing up might drop the waist, but it would also make it far too baggy AT my natural waist and ruin the fit.\n\nThe fabric is a twill with a sateen-ish finish; not too shiny, definitely not matte -- I think this could easily be dressed up for a fancier event or dressed down for work (as I did) with a blazer or jacket. I paired it with opaque tights, converse sneakers, and a beige leather jacket (it was too cold to style it the way I'd wanted, unfortunately -- would look super cute with chunky sandals or a high heel!). The hem hit a few inches above the knee -- short enough to be flirty and young, but not so short that I felt uncomfortable sitting down at work or in class. \n\nLoved it, and I'll be keeping it in my Unlimited queue. :) "}

Overall, it looked okay, but it wasn't as form fitting as I would have preferred, mostly due to the sizing, as the style itself is slightly looser.  If you are considering the dress, go down one size and get two sizes down as backup!  You will be nowhere near your normal size.  Trust me."}

It did feel a little worn, but because of the lace overlay, any fraying wasn't noticeable because the pattern is very busy anyway.

I could have definitely went one size down with a 4 (which is my normal size) but it still was a beautiful dress. Everyone loved the red and thought it was classy & sexy. It was incredibly comfortable, easy to use the restroom without unzipping, and really accentuated my features. I wore it with two stick-on cups that had a little padding in it which gave me some extra cleavage. It was a thicker material but I liked that because it made it more formal for the black-tie optional event I was attending.

{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "As other reviews have mentioned, this dress is super SHORT! Do not attempt to sit, bend to pick up something or dance/raise your arms too high! It's not a deal breaker but I was fussing with pulling the hem down all evening as it hit me about mid-thigh. I would recommend bringing a shawl/wrap to drape over your  lap if you're sitting. Wear nude undies all the way! There are 2 pieces to this dress: slip and the lace dress (back zipper). There is no button or hook to secure the slip with the dress and so you kind of have to adjust yourself. I just rented this for an outdoor wedding. While I did bake in the sun, the dress was perfect for the summer event and I unknowingly coordinated with the wedding party. The colour is a nice blush and is better in person than what the picture looks like. I just paired it with simple gold dangle earrings and nude pumps. I did find as others have mentioned, that the lace around the neckline did fall and spray starch/ironing would have helped significantly, but overall the length was the reason it does not get 5 stars. I also had an issue with the neck button closure in the back. It just wouldn't stay for me so I just used a safety pin to secure it."}

It was lightweight and easy- perfect for a spring wedding! The fabric is as great as all the other dresses, you can feel it was made well. One thing I didn't see in the pictures to tell you all: the dress has a slit that goes up pretty far, and the bottom is see through, but the dress has fabric to cover for you. It was all great, but I wanted to let you all know about it! The slit actually is great, it makes a fabulous dancing dress. \nYou will not regret renting this! I can see this being worn in spring and summer, perhaps winter given the right jacket."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I got a lot of compliments of this dress! It's very unique, and I love the Autumn colors or color blocking. I wore with strapping black heels - I had to wear very tall heels because the length of the dress landed slightly below my knees, and without heels it would have looked a little dowdy.  When I pulled it out of the garment bag it looked like it would be large for me, but it actually fit perfect.  My two complaints - it did have a black stain on the upper left corner, and the in seem of the dress is tight, so while I walked it would shift to the left which became a little bothersome. But overall I loved it."}

I am VERY pear shaped.  The pockets pulled funny, so I couldn't wear this.  It is also short.  It was mid thigh on me, and I am 5'2\".  Very pretty color, more orangy than red.  The nude netting underneath was a bit too much like my skin tone, so it just looked odd.  I really wanted to be able to wear this, but it just wasn't made for my body type.  VERY very pretty though.  I think that if you are petite and athletic body it will be PERFECT for you.  Beautiful lovely dress, just not for my body."}

Wore a smoot spanx and smooth bra and 3.5-4\" heel. Had a little bit of tail but was able to easily hold up when seemed to be in the way. Comfortable for dancing and full sit down dinner. Blue is a little unusual in color but flattering. I was able to wear a regular bra with straps and just have them gently off to side and this worked. Needed a little more up top that what I have, but a sticky bra/pad under a regular bra easily gave the added filler and cleavage that the dress needed. It is curvy, so some curves are needed to pull it off."}

At first, I was not happy - I do not like wearing black to spring weddings, and the other dress I had asked for was in vibrant colors. However, the dress was very pretty on, and I ended up wearing it anyway. I got many compliments - my fiance even said it was the prettiest I'd ever looked! He was sad when I sent it back. \n\nIt's a really interesting fabric, the under-layer is almost a sweatshirt-y material, a thick cotton. It makes for a really nice structure, but might not be the best if you think you might be going somewhere warm. Perfect for a Chicago spring wedding!"}

Other reviewers said they had problems with the straps, but they stayed perfectly in place for me and I got a ton of compliments on that piece alone.

The only reason why I didnt give this a 5 star rating is because the sequins tugged on my tights all night so i had to repeatedly pull down the slip underneath so the sequins wouldnt completely ruin my pantyhose.

The dress is a beautiful color.  Well made.  And can be dressed up for a formal event, (think accent color pump/heel and some sharp jewelery).  Or dressed down (think wedge sandal or pump sandal).  However, I did not get the opportunity to wear it either way.  As one other similar size reviewer commented, it does fit like a \"potato sack.\"  And belting it was not an option.  Length could have been fine with the right shoe.  But the fit of the dress was too big and matronly.  I have a bust, and thought the style might hide stomach and arm insecurities, and although it fit (and looked) large, I don't think that going down a size or two would have helped.  It was more about the style."}

I was worried about the neckline, but it was perfect even while wearing an everyday bra. My muffin top showed a little more than I wanted, but with fashion tape, it was perfection. I also didn't have to worry about the dress at all, it was exceptionally comfortable for an entire evening.

I was in it for over 12 hrs so that should attest to it's comfort factor! I received lots of compliments on it too. If I'm being honest, I wasn't overly \"wowed\" by this dress out of the box. It was a brighter yellow than I expected (I pictured more buttery/soft yellow) and for the rental price I expected a bit more I suppose. After seeing and wearing it, I felt that it should be more a $50-$75 rental (I wear a lot of specialty occasion dresses for my job that I own). With that said, I still am happy I wore it - it was light and SO comfortable. I have a larger bust (36D) and rented my usual 8 with a backup of a 10 based on reviews that it could be tight in the bust. The 8 fit like a glove! For my first rental experience, I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend this dress again. "}

I had a Beyonce themed bachelorette in the city and was so excited to have found the perfect dress and then I opened the box to find two navy gowns and not the beautiful Joan of Arc dress I requested. Disappointed, I called to inform them of the packing error and they immediately overnighted this dress (which I only really picked because there was nothing left of my other choices). I was disappointed about the situation but the dress was sleek and sexy paired with a red lip and a pair of sparkly heels. the mesh slits in the side showed off just a little skin which was perfect for me. I was not crazy about the length. The dress is on the shorter side and will ride up as the night goes on. Was not a problem in the dance club later but was a bit embarrassing at the dinner in the well-lit family restaurant. I liked the dress and the thickness of the material. The sleeves were nice for a cold night out but I probably would not choose this dress again with the many options available."}

The 4 fit much better. I'm usually more of a 4-6 kind of gal and the 4 felt good. The 2 was just a wee bit snug. "}

For my taller ladies, I would definitely recommend the long if available, or sizing up which is what I ended up doing because the 2 was longer although the 0 fit my body better.

I probably could have squeezed in the 6, but the 8 was great. I wore it for my sister-in-law's bridal shower, that I hosted. "}

I usually wear a 4, bit I felt the 6 had more fabric to overlap and looked better."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Wore this for my bridal shower and I can say, this one I do not want to send back. It was a backup since my original order couldn't be shipped. I was a little leery but thought this was the cuter of the two options they sent. I couldn't have been happier in the end! I love retro looks and this was that. It also wasn't form-fitting and showed a lot of leg.  I wore some daring stilettos and the look came out great. I got a lot of compliments. The only small complaint I have is the lining was acting weird and hanging out of the dress when I first put it on, but that somehow seemed to work itself out during the day, and it fell evenly later on. That lining also made the dress very hot, as I wasn't in a bit of hot environment. Other than that though, I loved it! If I were into white dresses for everyday wear I would probably buy it. "}

I didn't wear a bra (the dress is fitted enough that I was totally fine, despite my larger chest), although I would recommend some kind of cups or backless bra if you're uncomfortable. The wrinkle in the hem wasn't as big of a deal to me as it seemed to be to some others--it flowed well with the dress. The length was perfect, and the front was beautiful--great for pictures.

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "I absolutely loved this dress and I'm so happy that I chose it. It hugged my body in all the right places and was very easy to move in (walking, dancing, sitting, etc). My only two issues with it were in the bust and in the length. I wear a 34B, so I had to wear a padded, strapless bra to fill out the top portion of the dress so I wouldn't have to pull it up all night. This worked out great, so I highly recommend it if you have a smaller bust.  I'm also pretty tall, so with my 4 inch heels I was about 6'1\" and the dress felt a little short on me (which was to be expected) but no one else besides me noticed. It's pretty snug in the body, so you may want a bathroom buddy to help zip you back up if you need to take a trip to the Ladies' room, but the tight fit also held everything in and gives your body a great shape.  Overall, this dress is a knockout and I'll definitely rent it again if I have a formal event to go to. "}

I am tall (5'9\") and this dress was the perfect length barefoot. I would have liked it a bit longer since I wore heels with it but it still looked great and didn't have that \"too short\" look I often get in full length dresses. I received compliments all night and I felt like a bombshell in this dress. The slit does come up a little high but I didn't mind. The front also comes down a little low but I just pinned it together a bit at the bottom and it was perfect.

Got a lot of compliments all night, especially from my husband who said it made my butt look great :)  I didn't like how it gapped a little in the armpit area and like others mentioned, the bottom rides up and the mid-section cut out wasn't always visible.  I think the gapping was because it was actually a little big for me even though it was a size 0."}

I had marks from how tight it was. LIke other reviewers mentioned as well, the sleeves were pretty tight. I also ordered a 6 and the lace detail was getting pretty rough. It look well worn and there was even a hole in the sleeve of the 8. All in all it wasn't my favorite rental but it did the job. Definitely order a size or two up. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The dress was gorgeous and very flattering. It was much tighter in the bust than in the hips, despite having a relatively small chest. I would not recommend this dress to people who are more gifted in the chest area. The straps end up digging into your shoulders after a while, but the dress was overall very comfortable. The length seems like it would be great for all heights - Not too long, not too short. I would definitely recommend to a friend."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "It's a beautiful, classy dress.  Fabric is interesting and fits well and snug in the right places, and it's true to size... except... If you have a large chest beware.  Many of the reviews mentioned being able to just use fashion tape or pin it for a large chest.  This isn't really accurate if you're more than a C (I am guessing at that - I am a 36 F).  Fashion tape won't keep it covered/in place enough and will keep pulling apart/off and then you can see the tape. Pinning it is problematic because of the double layer of fabric - either it doesn't work or it bunches it up and you can tell it is pinned.  I forgot to bring a cami on the trip, which would have been the solution, so I spent the evening feeling self conscious and pulling the fabric back over my breasts. Photos were terrible if sitting down - then it really pulled apart.  I highly recommend trying to do all three (pin, tape, cami) way in advance so you aren't in a panic as you're getting ready for the event (like I was).  Other than that (which can really be an issue), it really is a beautiful and classy dress, fits well if you are slightly curvy - no gaps/extra fabric hanging loose."}

I tried to update my profile before this review but the tool isn't working, so for reference: 34DD, 5'4\", 142lbs, normally wear a size 6 skirt and size 10 shirt or dress from banana republic.\n\nPros:\n- so many compliments all night long\n- beautiful colour and texture in person\n- I'm 5'4\" and it hit in all the right places\n- boning and internal bra hooks in back. I wore a strapless because I'm not comfortable otherwise but you could definitely go braless in this dress\n- true to size. I ordered the 12R and 14R as back up because i was worried about this designer's sizing but I should've ordered the 10R and 12R backup. My normal dress size is a 10 and I think that would've fit perfectly. The 12 still worked out great especially since I have the bust to hold the dress up. I would definitely say order your normal dress size.\n\nCons:\n- The description of the dress length in the back says 58\" from shoulder to hem. I think they meant from top of dress to hem because I measured it out and at 5'4\" I went out and purchased extra tall wedges to be able to walk in them all night. I could've worn flats and only a few millimeters would be touching the ground.\n\nFYI:\nOrdered the necklace from RTR too and received so many compliments on that as well. I think my dress may have been one of the most complimented looks out of the 500+ employees at our event! \n"}

The dress is incredibly comfortable, the fabric is light enough for warmer seasons but kept me warm in 40 degree temps. The top fits a smidge large but the waist is snug, so this was only noticeable under the armpits. Although I ordered long lengths, both dresses looked like regular sizes by the tags. The 8R (I think?) came just above the floor when I, 5'9\", stood barefoot. My 4\" shoes were definitely visible, but the skirt has a bit of a flare to it that made it look almost intentional.\nCannot recommend this dress enough."}

Once on, the top is very fitted, but I think that works well given the way the bottom flows.

It hid and smoothed out other areas of my hips I was worried about.  Because of my pear shape - mainly due to small bust (32A) - the particular push-up bra I needed to wear to fill out the top of the dress actually poked out from underneath the dress straps, but I wore a cropped black cardigan with it anyway and I think most bras would work (if you need one).  I also wore spanx without any line issues.  Wore it on a night out at a speakeasy and won the admiration of the discerning hostess.

The base of the jacket is larger, or boxy as I believe another reviewer said, while the shoulders and arms are tighter.

The boxy bottom means it looks best with something tight at the waist and not so much with boot cut or low rise pants. It's also definitely navy.

{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "My husband who is an artist LOVED this dress, I don't typically purchase such bold designs (moreso classics) but this is exactly the benefit of renting! The fit was not ideal, but it was good enough. I would think this dress may fit best if you are petite or short-waisted and have either broad shoulders or chest because the dress is very short and I found it riding up, yet the open back means the top needs to be stretched to drape properly, so you may find yourself adjusting here and there. I am short-waisted and broad shouldered, so it worked out okay for me, but I did size up to get as much fabric coverage as possible. The whole thing is stretchy, so I could have worn the 10, or maybe even the 8, but I went with the 12 for this one due to the length. Typically I wear a size 8 or a 10 if it runs small or has no hip room. I had read this dress ran short, so I ordered the 10 & 12 anticipating I'd want more fabric. Basically I would not recommend if you are a long-bodied person or very tall because it's just not long enough. Sitting at dinner I felt I had to cover my lap with my napkin so no-one could tell there wasn't much dress still under me. Overall, super cute, loved the pix, glad I rented it, but also glad I don't own it. Get this one for mostly standing occasions!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I wore this dress for an Oscars themed black tie charity event. The dress was beautiful and worked well with my athletic, pear-shaped figure. I usually wear a 10 or a 12 in gowns, depending on the cut and the 10L fit well enough, even though it was still too short for my 5'11 frame in 2.5in heels. It was snugger across my hips in the front than I like but nothing that heavy duty Spanx couldn't handle. The back band of my regular (not low back) strapless bra was just barely low enough to work with the keyhole in the back of the dress and the sides didn't gap. A note on costumer service with RTR: I intially ordered the 12L as a backup size but I was notified the day before delivery that size was returned damaged prior to my rental and the 12R was no longer available. RTR did their best to help me find something else that would work for me but 2 days before the event, the pickings were slim so I had to settle. My mother's dress was also delivered with a broken zipper and she had to scramble and squeeze to fit into the alternate smaller size she ordered. These seem to be the (pretty likely to happen) hazards that go along with RTR so decide if the dress is worth the gamble for your event.  All in all, a lovely dress and an ok first experience with RTR. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress looks exactly like the photos. The sequins are woven very tightly, so there weren't any issues with some sticking up or catching on anything. It honestly looked like fabric. I thought the skirt fit very true to size. It is a little higher waisted than I thought, but that wasn't an issue for me. It also comes down slightly longer in the back. If you want it to fit like a pencil skirt, wear you're normal size. If you want a little looser size up. I'm 5'10 and I was genuinely surprised that the skirt was as long as it appeared in the pictures. If you are shorter, it may run a little long. \n\nThe only tiny con I have is that the sequin on the top part of the band can rub on your skin, which makes it a bit itchy. I just wore a tank top under my sweater and it was no issue. "}

I was going to wear that and use hem tape, but I was too worried it wouldn't hold and I'd trip over it.

I will echo other women's opinions that the chest is tight, and this dress would definitely not work for a woman with a large bust.

The materials are very nice and the lace overlay is intricate and beautiful. It looks timeless and expensive (which it obviously is) .\nCons: The blue is hard to see in anything less than fluorescent/studio lighting. Don't get this if you're looking for a blue/navy dress. It's basically black. The material is also relatively thin so I'm planning to wear it somewhere I won't worry about getting cold.

The nude lining on the dress has a sweetheart neckline, which made wearing a normal bra a bit difficult.

While on the heavier side, it was quite comfortable.  I danced like a fiend in it and never felt I was dying from overheating.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This was a back up dress for me that RTR had to help me get on the fly after a different dress was returned damaged. I am so glad I ended up with this dress instead! I was a little bit worried because reviews had labeled it as running small. I received a 2 and a 4 and ended up going with the 2. It is a dress that is absolutely designed for a defined waist. Best for hourglass shape, an athletic body type or a pear shape with a high defined waist.  The area where it is most fitted was directly under my rib cage and while snug, was not uncomfortable. It was extremely flattering. The neckline does dip low, and it was tight on my chest and I don't have very large breasts. I wouldn't recommend for someone with larger than C cup probably, but that is just my feeling. The top is fitted and flattering. The skirt is very full, and potentially could add some unwanted volume, but for me it was playful and fun and great for twirling on the dance floor! The fun detail is that the zipper in the back is top to bottom. The fabric was heavier, combined with the color made it a smash for a winter wedding. Definitely would rent this dress again, sad that I don't have it in my own closet."}

It was a little on the shorter side for me, mid thigh.  The sleeves could fall of easily due to the low scoop back, but could be securely held in place with adhesive.  One major con is that the lining on the sleeve doesn't stay in place, it slips out and is visible.  But since the lining is the same color as the dress, its not that big of a problem unless you're into detail.  Loved wearing the dress for the photoshoot!"}

The stretchy panels cleverly placed on the underside of the sleeves keep the fit super snug and slimming--so that's fabulous.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress was perfect for a warm outdoor wedding in LA. It was definitely a lot more cleavage than I anticipated but I didn't feel uncomfortable. The dress material itself is a bit on the heavier side which makes the dress less likely to fly up. I'm also pretty shore (5'2\") and so the dress was not too short on me.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Pros: This boning in the bodice of this jumpsuit gives you a lovely hourglass shape. I am thick and curvy and was worried that I wouldn't even be able to zip this up or, if I did, it wouldn't be flattering but I was wrong. It fit like a glove (I probably could have worn the 10 and have been a little more comfortable in fact) and really accentuated my curves. I am a C cup and did not have to adjust the top one single time during the night or wear a strapless bra. It has rubber along the top and a small amount of padding in the breast area which helped it to be perfectly form fitting.  As mentioned, I think a 10 would have been a better fit for me b/c sitting down the outfit got super snug, but I was able to move and dance all night without it even shifting once, so maybe not? It actually has a fair amount of stretch in the bodice so the 8 worked for me. \n\nCon: Yes, you will need to go to the bathroom in pairs, b/c you can not zip this back up on your own! It's a small inconvenience for a look that is so great! "}

I could've easily gone down a size and been just as comfortable. The buttons on top liked to pull at the chest. I think if I went down one size it might have opened up, but there was so much room it was strange that it pulled there.  \nI wore this to work with cream loafers, to a local brewery for a charity event, to a film festival with red keds, and to a cooking event with a yellow apron. It breathed nicely, did not ride up like some rompers do, and really stayed nice the whole time I had it. \nI was bummed to send it back and will definitely be trying out the other colors.

Some people complained about the sequins being scrathy; I did not find them scratchy. The dress is flash, but it's an elegant length and unless you have big ones, it offers decent chest coverage, so it wouldn't have to be Vegas-flashy. I thought of it more as Old Hollywood-flashy. I hope I can find a reason to rent it again. As a side note, I was about 3 months pregnant when I wore it and this dress would hide or accomodate a baby bump very well much farther into pregnancy."}

I picked this one between two similar dresses because this one looked nicer in photographs people posted -- and it was definitely the better choice! Everyone loved it. The dress was made so so well.. the detail, the design.. the dimensional stitching just made everything pop. The a-line fit was super flattering. I wish I could have kept it! Just be prepared ... if you don't want to tell people you rented for the occasion, have a planned response if people ask.. because if you rent this dress, everyone will be OBSESSING over how you look and asking where on earth you got it from! \n\n"}

The neckline isn't too plunging so I was able to wear sticky boobs since it is backless and it was tight enough to keep them on all night, even with lots of dancing. Highly recommend!

I like to accentuate my shoulders, my butt, and my stomach. This dress kinda camouflages all three of those areas. The shoulder fit looked more sleeveless that strapless. The extra fabric in front and back bunched up and just didn't work for me. It looked almost like a mistake.  \nThat said, the pictures of other women wearing it show a well-fitted and beautiful dress, so I think it was just me, or maybe my specific dress. IDK.

I could not have been happier with the dress and the experience.\n\nNow, let me tell you how awesome RTR stylists are.  The person that had rented my original dress before me did not return it.  I am not a quick decision maker.  I spent months deciding which dress I was going to pick.  I was called on the Tuesday morning before my event (dress was supposed to arrive on Thursday) and told the dilemma.  Every stylist I worked with was amazing.  I was told to pick any dress I want, at any price.  As the world's slowest decision maker, I could only narrow it to about 6 dresses.  They sent me each one they had in my size, which turned out to be 3 of them.  This dress was the winner!  All who I had help me pick a new dress agree that I looked better in this one than I would have in the original dress I chose, so this worked out in my favor, even if it caused some stress leading up to the gala.\n\nIn conclusion, return your dresses on time, please!"}

I wish I had rented the 12...  The 14 fit but I think the 12 would have been just a little more fitted through the waist.  The pattern definitely says LOOK AT ME! but it's really, really fun.  I would actually rent this dress again, just in the smaller size.  Also, the Rebecca Minkoff \"Keep Your Cool Clutch\" matches PERFECTLY.  The yellow really pops but the size keeps it subtle.  Loved it all!"}

I loved the sex appeal of the lace and the classiness of the neck line and length of the dress. There is no give to the material of the dress but again, still was able to dance!

However, the material of this dress is quite thick, so it's not clingy in any way.\n\nBe warned, though, if you're a little taller ... I'm only 5'3\" and the slit on this dress was pretty high - hit about two-thirds of the way up my left thigh.  Also, I was able to wear a backless Nu-Bra without any problems.\n\nI was going for a Rihanna circa 2012 Grammys look as well, so I went with a black and gold theme.  Did loose waves in my hair, a dark smoky eye with lashes, and black and gold nails.  Rented the Kenneth Jay Lane Deco Fab ring as well, though the necklace was mine.  Paired everything with 4\" black and gold cap toe pumps by Dolce Vita, and my trusty plain black clutch!\n\nThis dress was amazing and so unique.

The color is amazing (especially with a summer glow), and is also appropriate for a summer, evening wedding.

I am almost 5'2, so I was worried that it would be too long, but it hit me right below the knee and was incredibly flattering - not too long considering it is very form fitting. This line tends to run small so would recommend sizing up on the backup size. SO flattering and a great rental! "}

It's also more of a nude color than white in person as compared to the picture.  I wore a normal, nude color bra with it and that worked out great.  It was the perfect length on me (5'2\"), but I think it would be very short on a taller girl, so take that into consideration.  Overall, I would have bought this dress and kept it if possible!"}

The mesh sleeves and neckline, along with the tulle and shape, made me feel very classy and put together.  There is also very little accessorizing that needs done since the embroidery speaks for itself! Easy to move it, sleeves were loose but not billowy.

The color has a slight sheen (very pretty) with dark undertones, so pairing it with a black sweater was perfect for a chilly evening. Paired nicely with black heels, as well - and I imagine sandals would also work. The material is on the thicker side and doesn't have any stretch, but the cut is very proportionate on top and forgiving/flattering in the hips/leg area. Bonus on the pockets, which at first I found odd... but loved."}

I wore the size 6, without the belt, and it was completely true to size. The length was great - I'm 5'3\" and wore 3\" heels. The lace provided a nice accent around the neck and leg and I received numerous compliments on it! Definitely recommend for a date night or party!"}

As you can see, the 2 didn't bunch up or anything but the 4 would have been a little less \"work\" on my part while still being tight enough.  The 4 just wasn't available.

If anything, it wants to creep up over your shoulders. Super comfy. I'll definitely want to try and rent it again."}

I usually don't like to show cleavage, but everyone said it looked so good. I would recommend a safety pin. But if you're really comfortable with showing cleavage then it will be alright! I also could not get the dress on when I first received it, which was upsetting but I tried one more time and it fit perfect! I just had to zip it up in the front then maneuver it around.

I'm typically an 8 in dresses, and I wore the 10, which is why I say it runs small--but I have broad shoulders/back and the 8 was just too tight across my chest to breathe comfortably. The 10 was absolutely perfect. No spanx or bra necessary! So many compliments. Wish I could own it!"}

Overall, great dress for a masquerade themed holiday party. It was comfortable and I had no issues with having to pull the top up all night (which is my worry with strapless dresses).   Received many compliments.  I would rent this dress again. "}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "I loved how this dress fit a bit loose and flowy, but cinched back together at the waist to accentuate my figure. There is absolutely no give in the waist seam- it hits right over the ribs- so I was glad to have my backup size. The 4 was a great fit while I was rested and hydrated, but after a long flight and more travel to the venue, I was definitely dehydrated and needed the 6. Beware of the zipper, which is the main reason I didn't rate this 5 stars. The zipper runs down the side, but doesn't extend into the sleeves- it stops right at the armpit. It was quite the effort to get the dress back over my head and off of my arms, and I needed help to get out of it!"}

Unfortunately, its cuteness didn't outweigh how difficult it was to wear. This is a wrap dress, so the only thing holding it together is the verrrrry thin string that ties around your waist. I am not kidding when I say my bathrobe covers far more. There are two snaps (one at the bust and one mid-thigh) that literally wouldn't stay together for more than three seconds, and that's not even an exaggeration. This was by far the most \"difficult\" article of clothing I have ever worn. I was messing with it all day, trying not to reveal my entire body to the people around me.

The length on the 12R probably would have been better for me since I wore 4 inch heels.  The 10R length was fine, but the dress did not touch the ground with my shoes on (I do prefer my floor length gowns to actually graze the ground), but the 10R was by no means \"too short\", just maybe an inch or two shorter than I would have preferred.  The dress truly fit like a glove...My only issues (and I hesitate to say issues because these things weren't even that bad) were that it did irritate the inside of my arm from the sequins (but that's something to expect when wearing sequins, so...nbd), and the ruching around the stomach area on the left side did sag a little giving the illusion of a bit of a tummy problem,   But it was dark in the event, so you really couldn't see it.  It would have bothered me more if I was in daylight.  All in all, it was a gorgeous dress, I received many compliments on it, and I'd definitely recommend it!"}

I wear a 36DDD bra size, so I think this might have worked better for someone that's smaller on top.

I couldn't find a single other dress that matched the color on this one; I walkways wanted a green prom dress and the green of this dress was a bright, glowing, beautiful shade of emerald.

In terms of fitting, I would normally never consider myself a petite, I'm just under 5'6'', but after reading countless reviews on how long the dress ran, I decided on the petite and it was a great decision!

The zipper broke on the size 4 (my usual size) when I was trying it on, but I was still barely able to fit into the 2.  The coverage in the chest area was so good that I didn't need special undergarments.  Lovely dress!"}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "I wore it with a camel colored belt. The straps were a little long for me because I'm a 34A so the dress gapped in the front a little bit. My hair was down so I just cinched the straps at the top in the back to tighten them up a bit. I wore with flat sandals - I'm 5'9.5 and it was a good length, not dragging."}

Definitely wear with thin, nude undies! I wore it with a thin black bra (sticky bra malfunction) but it looked fine. Great length; not too short and a little longer than mid thigh on me (I'm 5'9 plus 3 inch heels). Fabric wasn't as thick as I expected but I would still rent again. Classy and sexy!"}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 3, "review": "This dress is gorgeous and I received tons of compliments at the wedding I wore it to - many from strangers. However, by the end of the night, I couldn't wait to take it off. It runs quite small, especially in the rib cage, and the lace started to irritate my skin after about an hour. I had rug burn-type sores on my neck and underarms for a few days after. I wound up with this dress when my first choice became unavailable and this was one of the few that was available for the weekend I needed it. Perhaps if I had known to size up I wouldn't have had such bad chafing. It was also torn in the shoulder, which was frustrating, but not noticeable to others. "}

One thing I will note is that since I am short, it didn't really look like the dress was shorter in the front. "}

{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "I'm 5'8\", 122 lbs, and 34A, and the 2L was too big, but RTR doesn't offer 0L sizes. The length, with 2\" heels was ok, though for closer ballroom dancing was a little bit too long and kept getting in the way. It was too big in the waist and chest (as other reviewers have commented), a push-up bra wasn't sufficient to fill out the dress as the whole upper body is cut for someone with a much wider rib cage, not just larger bust. Unlike other rentals, this didn't travel very well, it arrived very wrinkled, so make sure you have time to iron before your event--but lucky it didn't wrinkle during the event from sitting. During the day the color looks quite green, but in evening event lighting it looks like dark teal, falling more into blue. The cut out in the front was fun, and the fabric was a little stiff, but fluid, so it swayed elegantly while dancing and walking. This was a last minute back-up, as RTR wasn't able to deliver my dress.   "}

I paired it with a silver skinny belt (can't see it in the photo) and a silver necklace. It's lined which is nice, too. The greatest thing about the dress - it has bra strap snaps under the shoulder so your bra will never show! I would definitely recommend this dress."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I really enjoyed this dress. I think it ran slightly large. I tend to wear a 2 or 4 and the 2 definitely fit better. It does have 2 slits in the front which hit me about 3 inches above the knee, well below my fingertips so not too risqu\u00e9. The slits however did make the dress a little challenging to sit in without exposing too much. The dress was just above the ground with 2-3 inch heels on me. The back is great, shows some skin without dipping too low. I don't think a bra is totally necessary, but I did wear my NuBra. The color was great as well, a really nice, deep royal blue. Would definitely recommend!"}

I had to wear 3\" heels with this, any taller and the regular would have been too short. \nThe dress has a subtle mermaid fit which you can't see in the photo, so this looks great if you have an hourglass figure. However, I think this dress would flatter most body types. It's more fitted at the waist to give you shape and hugs your hips in all the right places.

It's comfortable to wear and fitted to emphasizes the body quite well. However, if you are self conscious about, perhaps a little belly bulge (like mine), the ruching on the dress does conceal a little bit but not tremendously well, so I would recommend wearing the belly Spanx underneath. On a few occasions, I did have to pull down the part of the dress that is draped over the shoulder as it would ride up a little during dancing, but that's hardly a complaint. It's a decently modest dress but the exposed shoulder adds a touch of sexy. Overall, this dress is infinitely classy and elegant in fit, color, and silhouette. "}

As soon as I walked into the wedding venue I was complimented on my dress. I felt gorgeous and would definitely rent again! "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I loved this dress even more than I thought I would. I was a little nervous because the material is the type that normally shows every lump and bump, but I was delightfully surprised by how nicely it laid and was actually very slimming. Unlike a typical DVF wrap dress that you need a cami for, it was more conservative in the chest without needing much adjustment. It also wasn't huge in the armpits like some wrap dresses can be. I think the medium would fit anyone size 6-10 (that's my range). It also didn't blow open or gape when sitting. A++ love this one!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore this dress to the theater and felt great wearing it. It is made out of heavy (soft) material and is lined throughout (except for the sleeves), thereby hiding lots of sins. The material is a bit on the casual side, but the sleeves make it a bit more dressy. The dress fit true to size and fit exceptionally well for my C-cup chest.  The skirt definitely has an A-line to it rather than being straight.  It's a bit short, so I wore it with black tights. Perfect dress for the winter and/or air-conditioned venues. I will rent this dress again."}

The dress is a pinky peach color,  which was great for an engagement party right at the end of summer/ beginning of fall.  \nCons : the shape is definitely straight,  almost boxy, which is good for hiding a belly, but if you're very tiny, you might get lost in it.  I honestly liked the shape,  it had a very boho chic vibe,  but can see it not working for everyone.  Overall,  the dress felt like one I've always had in my closet,  I felt super comfortable in it, but still a stand out look. "}

I did have to wear Spanx and tummy still showed.  Bust was too roomy and waist was more fitting and thus I went with a size 8 instead of a 6.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "Beautiful dress, I felt so lovely in it and was complimented constantly. The skirt was light and airy, it floated after me as I walked. However, the boning in the bodice isn't perfect so it pokes up the top and doesn't lie exactly as it does in the picture, which you can see in the selfie. Also, the skirt is very delicate and pretty much wants to rip itself. It will catch on everything, make sure you get insurance on this one!"}

I had rented this dress for a Black Tie event in NYC, and was unsure of whether the dress would work out or not, as I normally prefer to try things on before I purchase them, just because they don't always fit right. I had rented both the 4R ad 6R, but went with the 4R as I felt more secure with the top not falling, and it fit better and snugger overall. I have a 34D top, and i had no troubles whatsoever, did not have to pull it up once the entire night, nor did i need to use tape. The only downside to this dress is the back has quite the train, even with 4 inch heels on, I constantly had people stepping on the back of the dress and I had to hold it up when I walked anywhere.

I wore to an October wedding with nude pumps and chose a fun navy necklace to make it feel more fall-ish. The only downside to it was the straps are very wide so it's hard to get used to it and it kind of squished my boobs (like the other reviews mention its tighter in the torso) but it didn't look bad at all. Oh! and you can wear a regular bra too! I ordered a 2 and 4 and the 4 was way too big up top but the 2 fit perfect since it held me in.

I was perfectly comfortable, but when I look back at pictures it looks a little scandalous on me.\nAnd if you are planning on dancing, beware!

It had a slight give to it - and ran very true to size. I'm only 5'1\", though and was disappointed that the length was way too long with my 3 1/2 \" heels (I won't wear anything any higher for comfort's sake). But I called customer service and they said it was fine if I used some iron on stitch witchery to shorten it - as long as I undid it before shipping back. I was the Mother of the Groom, and the colors of the wedding were light beige and navy so this was perfect. It was comfortable enough to eat in, dance in and enjoy the long day and evening!! It has a lovely V in the back, but overall is modest enough for a church ceremony without feeling self-conscious. Like I said in the summary - it really plays up blue eyes!  I've rented several times from RTR and was totally confident that I would get the gown in time and have a wonderful experience - regardless of the magnitude of this event - it just doesn't get much more important than being MOG and having a great dress!  As expected, I was NOT disappointed. It was fabulous and I will rent again for my next big soiree`!"}

The fitted style and light color mean that every lump and bump will show - I recommend wearing spanx for a seamless look.

The dress is listed as Ultramarine which is by definition, deep blue, this dress is definitely purple. A beautiful shade of deep purple and I loved it but incase you are looking for a blue dress, this is not. The fabric is light and beautiful but does not have any stretch, keep that in mind when choosing a size. The back has a surprisingly deep keyhole with a button closure which is actually a nice touch with the high neckline and probably gives just a bit of room for bustier gals. I included a picture of the back to show that the keyhole opening is deep enough that it can expose a bit of your bra band especially if you have a 3 or 4 wide closure. \nOverall, I loved the dress and would suggest it.

Being the bodice was fitted I was more comfortable in the 6 than the 4 (which I would have had to work at to get closed - due to wider back/bust on my part).\n\n It fit well, was flattering but it just didn't have the wow factor I was hoping for. It was a little stiffer to wear because of the lace overlay (which as other reviews noted had its fair share of snags). The material itself is just bound to get snags and other imperfections with wearing - any onlooker probably wouldn't notice and it didn't overly bother me but worth a note. The straps were thinner and if the dress had been a little tighter probably would have dug into my skin while wearing. \n"}

I am 5'8' and certainly curvy but have a smaller top and waist. It was TIGHT! I probably would have worn the large but they were out of that size. The dress has some give but is not super stretchy and is definitely short so I'd size up for the backup size. I would not have been able to wear without the tights. The detail on the shoulder is the best part but it makes it hard to lift your arms so this is not a dress for dancing.

My husband and I finally discovered that I laid down, we were able to get the zipper up but ALOT of effort went into it.  There is some itchiness/scraping going on underneath the arm because of the sequins but nothing that you won't forget about once you are having fun.  I would've ordered the dress in a short but the regular was all that was available.  I'm 5'2\" and with a decent sized heel, the dress still touched the ground and I felt like I had to hold it up while I was walking just to be on the safe side.  Overall it is a very pretty dress and I feel like it covers up the right parts. (on a sidenote, I also ordered the 8R which fit but had the same issue with the zipper.  I decided to stick with the 10 because there was a dramatic difference in the chest area one size down.  Way more of my chest showed in the 8 than in the 10 so I stuck with the 10)"}

The color and style were perfect. The dress was just simple enough for the low cut neckline and the bright color, and the pockets were a huge bonus. The only downside was that the top of the dress was very loose, and you obviously can't wear a bra so there is no extra \"padding\" to help hold up the sleeves. Sadly I did have a Janet Jackson moment that luckily no one saw, but it made me very self-conscience about the straps for the rest of the night. I would highly suggest using a lot of double sided tape when renting this dress!"}

I was so worried it wasn't going to fit, I actually bought a back up dress just in case. However, when I got this dress in the mail, before I even tried it on, I prayed it would fit. The colors were so vibrant and the design is so classic, but modern. I just feel in love with it! I was worried about the length, but it was great! It's on the shorter side, but I loved it! I felt sexy, tall, slim, and beautiful in this dress. I got so many compliments on this dress, and how I looked in it. I had to present the senior video at banquet and on my way up to the front all my friends were cheering and saying how good I looked because this dress showed everyone that I finally broke out of my shell. I couldn't be happier with this dress, or the night. There are no cons to this dress. However, I did read something about fashion tape for the back, but I didn't need any.

I presently wear a size 12, although my normal size is a 10 (post baby weight gain), but was able to more than comfortably fit the 10.  As others have noted, the stomach area will photograph large as it is not a \"fitted\" dress, so I would suggest going down 1 size.  Also, I have DDD boobs and still had plenty of room in the top (would have liked it a little more snug in the top).

It is a tighter fit than I would typically wear to a wedding but the color and pattern are so lively that the body-hugging neoprene remains very tasteful! The temperature outside ranged from 65-85 throughout the day/ night and I was never too hot. The neoprene was amazing and I got a lot of compliments on the dress! I would definitely recommend this dress or any of the Clover Canyon dresses! I am typically a girl who wears black and I loved this dress. One tip: just be aware of the dress riding up.

The color is also beautiful in person. I have a smaller waist and larger hips and tend to look disproportionate in this type of silhouette, but this dress did not make my hips look wide. Only downside is that since I have a smaller bust, I had to use some fashion adhesive tape to prevent unwanted exposure."}

Cons: the size 10 straps were way too loose, impossible to wear as the model does without some fashion tape.  However the size 8, though it was too small to wear, the straps were shorter and laid much nicer, so I think there is variation depending on the wear/tear of the dress.  Pros: Everything else!  It looked great, flowed nicely, and was a good length for my height.  Just touched the ground barefoot, and was a safe level for dancing in heels.  Was supportive to wear without bra, and looked much nicer without one.  Unfortunately due to a major mishap (left at home while traveling for a wedding!)

This has just the right amount of sexy, but keeping it classy and tasteful.\n\nMy only two issues were that the middle part under the band did pucker, but it did with either size. I felt like I had to keep pulling the dress down. Also, after only a couple hours of wearing it, I woke up the next morning with a rash on my back from the dress fabric.

I would not have gone up a size, but just if you have a big bust it will likely gap a little bit if you fasten all the buttons.  It was so so warm, too, without bulk.

I ordered a size 0 and 2. The 0 was a little snug in the middle once the dress was zipped so I ended up wearing the 2. The only negative was the length - fell a little farther past my knees than I would have liked( most likely due to my shorter height). I would definitely rent this dress again! "}

Since I'm 5'1, I knew that it would hit lower than I would have preferred but it was still lovely.  Got tons of compliments.  My arms are a little chubby so I did have some rubbing issues with the sequins but  nothing too uncomfortable.  I wore a bra that 'sticks' to you.  A strapless bra wouldn't work since the back strap would show.  "}

This dress is comfortable, fits true to size and is beautiful but it is long. I am 5 10'' and wore 4'' heels and the back of the 10R was just barely off the ground. Worked great for me but it's something to be aware of. I loved this dress and felt awesome all night."}

The lining, however, was super clingy and the material shows all imperfections (although there is an overlay of the beautiful flowers - they are placed in a way that didn\u2019t hide my weird bulges). I put on the 16 and it was better but still had the same weird lining issue. I wore a slimmer and it helped but I still felt slightly uncomfortable. The top of the size 16 was too big and the 14 top fit great, it\u2019s just my bottom half that caused the issue.  I still really loved this dress and it photographed well.  Just wish I had felt more confident.  The first pic I posted shows the lining issue. Second pic at the wedding with the slimmer and size 16. "}

The bottom was a little baggy on me but the length was great for a work party - it hit about an inch or so above the knee.

It wasn't too long, I'm 5'2 and wore 5 inch heels, I have a tendency to hold long dresses when I am walking, but I don't think I needed to with this one, it's just habit. I got a ton of compliments, which was important since I wore it to my ex-boyfriend's wedding hehe.. but the biggest surprise for me was... It's rose gold!!

My height falls between a regular and long length dress and probably could have gotten away with the 2L backup size I ordered. But I opted for the 4R in an effort to wear shorter heels.

It definitely fits small up top  - I have a small bust and it was great, lots of support and no need for a bra (good since a regular strapless bra would have shown in the back).

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This dress was beautiful, very flattering, and because of the corset, no need for a bra! That said, I did have some issues with the fit and lay of the dress. Firstly, I'm 5'6\", and the 8R was a tad too short for my liking (the 8L wasn't available, nor was the 10R or 10L). I did wear about 3\" heels with the dress though, and just made sure that it the skirt was pulled down all night. \n\nMy other issue with the dress (which almost caused me to return it) was the underlining of the skirt. It's hard to tell in the pictures, but there's a blacking net lining in the skirt between the lace and the beige satin, almost a crinoline texture. The dress arrived to me with a VERY wrinkled lining - so much so that I thought maybe the lining was damaged. It cause the skirt to bunch up at the bottom so that dress from the waist down was really unflattering. After having a mild heart attack, reaching out to RTR, and finding out that my options for back-up dresses were very limited, I elected to have the dress professionally steamed at a local dry cleaner. That made all the difference - the skirt laid much more flat, and looked lovely after it had been properly handled. \n\nAlso, there are a number of satin buttons with loop closures at the neck of the dress, the back. Several of the loops were broken, but it didn't matter to me because I wore my hair down. If I'd been planning to have my hair up, it would've been an issue.\n\nThis was my first less-than-perfect RTR experience, but all's well that ends well."}

I am pretty choosy about red since I am prone to blemishes. This red is just the right color. \n\nI wore this to a work dinner and then directly to a party at a bar. With just a few accessory changes in the cab, it was a hit at both parties. I was nervous about the see-through portions of the dress for the formal work dinner. Because the lace was so well done, it was not tacky at all. Also, the high neck, cap sleeves, and knee length helped with the modesty factor. I received tons of compliments and did not feel inappropriate. I felt fantastic! \nThen  at the party at the bar it was a standout dress. Most of the other dresses were sequined or body-con style.

The fit of the dress was as described by others, good fit through the chest eventhough I have a full bust, loose at the waistline, and a little less room at the hip.  I have an hourglass figure and found that I needed the size four to feel comfortable at my hip.  I can often wear a size two moving up to a four at times to accomodate my chest, but decided to size up here for more room in the hips since I would be sitting for a good part of the day.

If you are trying to decide whether to size up or down for your backup size I would recommend sizing up especially if you do not have a straight and narrow figure."}

I love how the cape detail does cover your shoulders, which is so great for a formal affair in the colder months.

The dress was rruched in the torso and cut nicely around the neck, arm and back so that I was able to wear my supportive under garments without worries they would be showing.

I was worried about it being to bedazzled, but it was sophisticated and classy - sexy without being overtly so.  The rosy gold color was lovey and brought the best out of my pasty-white Michigan winter skin.  Loved the longer length (which hit me mid-knee at 5'9\") but could be shortened, I suppose, with fabric tape.  Lots of compliments.  I would definitely considering ordering it again. I wore it with the Kendra Scott Rose Gold Alex earrings.  Perfect pairing and kept the dress from being too fancy or overworked.  The zipper does pop out a bit in the back, creating a little bump.

I would have had to pin the under arm area just so much bra wouldn't stick out. \n\n2) The slits are unflattering. The model makes it look like the slits in the dress are understated. They are not--it's one of the main focuses of the dress. I love showing my legs, but I just thought that these slits were too flashy for such a sweet, classy dress and print.\n\n3) The waist area is too large. It acted more like a sack than a form-fitting, empire waist should do.\n\nI give the dress three stars because the fit may have been wrong, and it may be really nice if the size is appropriate. I would definitely order a size down."}

The leather is buttery soft.\nIt is not at all fitted, so don't go a size down, the chest will likely be too narrow.  This is not a dress for busty ladies, unless they are very petite and tiny.  It was also very short, down to about my ankles.  "}

It is thick material and might be a bit much for hot summer weather. "}

I rented the two which fit nice on top over a white blouse.  The bottom had lots of extra room and was not fitted."}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 3, "review": "I wore this with high-waisted jeans to a couple of brunches. The top is quite fun and looks good with the sleeves down or on the shoulders. I wore the sleeves up, as they were a little tight when I pushed them down on my shoulders (and I don't have a big upper body). There was plenty of room in the waist and there is no open gap at the armpits/sides, which drives me crazy. Fun weekend or vaca top."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Loved this dress.  It fit perfectly, fitted through the chest and waist area and then flowed out nicely around my hips.  For a pear shaped body type it worked very well.  The fabric was light and in 90 degree Atlanta heat, I was warm, but not unbearably so.  The pop of gold sparkle at the bottom was a really nice touch.  I received compliments from multiple strangers throughout the night.  A great dress for a cocktail party or moderately formal wedding."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I was very happy with this dress. I went with the smaller size (my normal size) because it pulled in the waist a little more and gave it more of a shape. It is a little longer than some of the other dresses, ends just above the knee. Fit well, was able to dance all night after the wedding. Very comfortable. The color was awesome, brighter than it appears on the model."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The dress arrived with tags on (both sizes) so I was excited it was brand new.  I typically wear a 6 and it fit perfectly- really hugs your curves but the long sleeves help keep it really elegant.  The 8 also fit well just a little less snug and a bit longer.  I opted for the 6 at my husband's urging :)  You can wear normal undergarments and it is very comfortable - I didn't find it scratchy at all.  I got a ton of compliments on it!  I wore some pretty drop earrings and rented a gold bangle.  I wore my own delicate necklace which worked well but it really didn't need much.   The length was perfect- I am 5'4\" and it hit below my fingers and above the knee which was great for me.  Overall great dress!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress is everything!  It fits true to size and is a show stopper!  The back is open so you can't wear a bra.  It is very comfortable and a flattering shade of red.  I wore this is a formal wedding and I felt classy and beautiful."}

I'm 5'3 and have a hard time with everything being too long on me. I wore a comfortable 3in heel and the jumpsuit sat just above the floor. It came a up a little high on the neck and felt snug, but it wasn't unbearable uncomfortable. The reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I didn't realize the legs were split all the way up (it's just overlapping fabric. Every time I sat down it exposed my whole thigh. I didn't have black spanx so I wore my nude ones, it was annoying to monitor all night. Either wear regular underwear or black spanx"}

This can easily be worn with a strapless backless bra but I felt comfortable enough with just forgoing a bra altogether. I have more bachelorette parties (including my own) later this year and can't wait to rent another cute sexy dress! "}

This dress was perfect for my 24K themed birthday dinner, hugs all of your curves!! Highly would recommend!!"}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress was super cute, I would wear it from work to happy hour easily and would pair it with neutral toned accessories. I would strongly suggest sizing up, I would have been more conferrable in the size M ( I usually wear size 4 in dresses). There is comfortable room in the waist but no room in the bust. The fabric has some stretch but not a lot! I am 5'7 and this dress fell above my knee, mid thigh area.  It can be worn with a regular bra and Spanx would certainly help! This style would work best on women with these body types: Apple, Hourglass, Athletic, Pear, Petite, Straight & Narrow, Full Bust"}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "I ended up wearing the smaller of the two sizes I ordered - the larger had a lot of space, and I only regretted my choice after eating a very large dinner - it is pretty fitted at the waist, and the fabric does not have any stretch. The arm holes were not very generous, either, but they worked. Overall, this was a cute, interesting, easy to wear dress, without being too out there! It's also fairly short, so plan accordingly."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "This is a beautiful dress and extremely flattering. I wore it for Valentine's Day and my boyfriend was drooling over me! haha :) However, it's very fitted so you need to wear spanx or some type of fitted undergarment. I don't think this dress would be good for girls with smaller busts because I usually have to go up a size because of my chest but the size 2 fit me perfectly."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I loved the dress. It was really comfortable and I got a bunch of compliments on it. I got both size 4 and 6 to try on.

The green is a perfect pop of color (thought it look great with my red hair). Such a cute dress! "}

The neckline does droop slightly, but I didn't think it looks sloppy. A note of caution that longer earrings easily get caught in the lace. The skirt was short enough to show some leg, but long enough that I could dance without fear of a flashing incident. Overall, the dress was comfortable and beautiful! "}

I didn't need to go up to a 10, but I should have just waited around for the 8 to come back in stock. Either way, the skirt is stunning and you should rent it. "}

I had no problems at all, and absolutely loved the dress! The 8 was just a touch too big, but a 6 would've been too small, so the fit was overall great! The 8 gave me some extra room for some more cake! It hit right above my knee, and was elegant enough but I could spend the night dancing in it. Would definitely recommend! "}

{"fit": "small", "rating": 4, "review": "I read that this dress was tight across the bust, so I ordered a size 8 and 10 instead of a 6 and 8. I have a large back/bust, a swimmers body, and there was no way I was getting the 8 to zip over my back. As a result, the 10 was a little lose in the waist, but not that noticeably. Overall, the fit was very cute, and the dress was extremely comfortable. It has pockets which I loved! They didn't make the hips bulge and they added to how comfy I was. My hands were constantly in them. Also, this dress is a beautiful, thick, almost wool like material (but it's lined so that isn't against your skin) so it is best for mild/sunny temps. "}

A little area of sequins were missing towards the bottom on the front, but it was completely unnoticeable amongst all the other sequins. I had been a little concerned ahead of time about the red sequins on the dress and was really happy to see that they didn't stand out too much.  I could still wear my pink sash without feeling like it clashed. This was really the perfect bling dress for my fun night out!!"}

Unfortunately, this did not drape across my hips the way I would have preferred as there were creases and a horrible side zip seam that distorted the appearance of my hips. The dress was also too big in the top. I also found the dress to be a little too short (without shoes on). I imagine this flatters more straight body types. I wouldn't recommend this for pear shapes."}

Fully lined and comfortable to wear with soft leather trim around the neck and lapel.  It did run true to size but I WAS surprised at how tight the small was on me- I have small shoulders despite being larger on the bottom and can normal wear a small in tops and jackets but definitely needed the medium in this style. The other thing that surprised me a bit in person was how \"cut away\" the styling was in the front- and that it curved up a bit in the back... it made it a little challenging to find the right top for underneath but a slinky t-shirt ended up working best. \n\nThe design is even better in person- it almost look like tiny metal washers laid out in little pyramid patterns.  Perfect amount of glitz without being in your face sequins. "}

I ordered an XS but ended up wearing my backup size S (I didn't even try the XS on), so definitely order up for your backup size.

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "The color of this dress is really vibrant. I loved it. The neckline is beautiful - the contoured V shape is pretty and a little sexy without plunging too deep or showing too much cleavage. The A-line skirt is super flattering. The fabric was nice and thick, almost like scuba fabric, so it was comfortable and everything looked nice and smooth. \n\nDefinitely size down! I was nervous about it but after reading reviews I sized down and it was great. I ended up wearing the 4, and usually I wear an 8 (sometimes a 6 depending on designers)."}

I didn't wear any special undergarments, though it was tight enough that I was just aware to stand up straight all night so not to show tummy lines.

I found the overall fit to be too large--I would have rented a size 8 but it wasn't available. The arms were very large and as a result of the fit the dress was drooping in the front.

The pockets were probably my favorite feature, felt I could carry my phone and it wasn't noticeable at all.

The material is a bit heavy which was perfect for my outdoor winter photos but probably wouldn't be the best for dancing all night at a wedding. The armpit holes to do cut in a little which can be a problem if you have a large chest like I do. My one con is that the underneath of the skirt is white which looks weird when the flaps come up in the wind. "}

{"fit": "small", "rating": 3, "review": "This dress is gorgeous and definitely stands out. I received tons of compliments. It photographs beautifully as well. With that being said, I only give it three stars because there are quite a few negatives to the fit and cut of this dress. It is VERY tight and has NO ROOM for give around the ribs and high waist. The straps don't stay up. It's almost as if they should have been placed lower on the backside of this dress. I used tape on the upper part of the strap and the neckline. I normally wear a size 6. I wore a 10R and felt like the dress was going to pop every time I breathed in, sat down, or bent over. The clasp actually broke before I even left the house. If you are even somewhat unsure of the size, read the reviews very carefully and size up at least one size. I would even recommend going up two sizes, if possible. If you are very small or very large chested, beware. I wear a 36D and had a Janet Jackson moment, despite having double sided tape on the neckline. If you are small chested, you will probably have trouble filling out the front of the dress. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 3, "review": "This blouse was too big and too small for me at the same time. It is a crop, so goes best with higher waisted pants. It is really wide at the waist and tighter on the shoulders and sleeves. It didn't give any shape around the midsection, but there was too much fabric to tuck in and it slipped out anyway. The tie around the neck was a little awkward, the fabric didn't allow for an easy tie and the straps easily folded so that it didn't seem like a cohesive part of the shirt. I did like the sleeves, they were elegant. The pattern was pretty as well. I would not recommend for someone with a similar shape to me (tall, long torso, smaller chest), but it might work better for someone else who is shorter."}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 3, "review": "I ordered the coat because I loved the color, cut and texture of the coat. Unfortunately, the coat was way too big, even in the smallest size.

I was a little nervous because there weren't many reviews or pictures yet, but I think the dress was just a newer rental.  It was pretty form fitting but in a flattering way; the material was fairly forgiving as well (aka-stretched where it needed to stretch).  I was a little concerned about the arms being tight since that has been an issue for longer sleeved dresses for me in the past, but that was not the case.  I held back the fifth star because the zipper was a bit of a pain, and although I wore it with tights, I think it would have been itchy without them.  All in all, I would definitely think about renting this again."}

The length really varies from suit to suit (my backup size was too long and my first size was a little short) so it would be nice to have different heel heights available.

The dress is VERY comfortable - stretchy material, easy to walk in, and I only had a tiny bit of irritation under my arms from the sequins despite sensitive skin. I will say it's not very \"plum\" colored... It looked dark gray or slate in just about all lights. But that's ok, it's still beautiful. Do note that the dress is fitted through your hips and has almost a mermaid-style bottom. So if you're super curvy and don't want to flaunt it, avoid this dress.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I rented this dress for a Christmas party.  It was the first year with the company so I wasn't sure what everyone else was wearing.  I was told that some wore cocktail dresses and others wore gowns.  I figured this dress wasn't too fancy to be over the top.  It was perfect.  It came in the mail as was promised and didn't have a wrinkle on it (the Christmas party was out of town, so I had to fly).  The garment bag was very handy on the plane as I was able to carry it on with my husbands suit in the garment bag as well.  Once I got to the hotel it was a little wrinkled so I ran the shower real hot and hung the dress on the door inside the shower.  The steam took the wrinkles out very quickly.  The zipper was a little difficult to zip around the \"cummerbund\" portion on the waist but we got through it.  The dress was bulky when walking up stairs.  There was a lot of material to it.  All in all it was a great party and the dress wore well all night, even dancing.  The return was crazy easy.  The only thing I would do differently next time is order wayyyy in advance.  There was a particular dress I wanted but when I was ready to rent (3 weeks before the event), my sizes weren't available so I needed to go with plan B.    "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I thought this dress was very flattering. I was surprised that I wore the 8 and not the 6. The dress really has no stretch in it and it felt a little tight right below the bust when zipped. There was plenty of room in the skirt area and I don't think the size made a difference there. I decided to opt for comfort and not vanity! I loved the color - blue is really gorgeous on anyone. My only criticism ... the shoulder straps felt very long and the plunge very deep. This is where lingerie tape is a must (I did order it - thank god!). Remember, sequins are hard and not always comfortable ... but this dress did a good job with the embellishments."}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "My boyfriend loved this dress, while I felt less enthusiastic about it. That probably has more to do with feeling uncomfortable in long, bodycon dresses. As soon as I put it on, my boyfriend raved about how classy, while still sexy, I looked. Lots of compliments at the party I attended, so in the end it was a successful rental. I ordered the 2L and 4L and ended up wearing the 2L. The 4L had a missing hook in the back, and had I needed to size up, I would have been afraid of the zipper coming down all night long. Wearing a regular strapless bra is probably best, and I'd advise against Spanx or underwear at all. Even with a thong, your pantyline will be visible in the front. For reference, I'm 5'7\" and in a 2L and 4 inch heels, only the toes of my shoes were visible, which I thought was the perfect length. "}

Fits great because it oddly has room but you wanna have the flattest tummy you can.\n\nDouble sided tape is MANDATORY. It has to go on your shoulders and on your back underneath the dress because if not it will slip constantly. I bought it knowing that from other reviews so double sided tape =  non issue.\n\nOther than that, the pictures speak for themselves! \nIt actually make the butt look a bit smaller than it actually is, just as an fyi but that's fine because you want the focus to be more on your back, less on your butt or else it could get a bit trashy. lol.\n\nHappy renting ladies!\n\n\n"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This was a terrific dress. I wore it to a \"formal\" wedding in Tucson, AZ. The ceremony was outside at 5pm and the party lasted until midnight, and the weight of this was just perfect. My backup size was an 8L, but the 6L definitely fit better and was much more flattering. The fit was snug but not tight, and I don't remember any discomfort wearing the dress for 8 hours. It's great that you can wear a normal bra with it, and the shoulder straps even have those little snap loops that will hold your bra strap in place, although I didn't use them. \n\nI had initially planned to wear this with heels, but it looked ridiculous, even with the long size (I'm tall!). So I wore flats, and it was perfect and more comfortable anyway :) I don't have a huge bust, so didn't have any issue with excess cleavage at a wedding with all my family.\n\nThe skirt is so fun, and I had forgotten that it has a huge slit up the front. The skirt panels alternate between a gauzy fabric and the satiny one, which made it nice and cool. Plus there was the slit. It really was only noticeable if I wanted it to be, and made dancing fun. There is a lot of skirt fabric, so I did have to pick it up when walking up or down stairs. \n\nOverall, this dress was a winner. It was comfortable, extremely flattering, could be black-tie without being black, and was unique both in the neckline and the skirt. I would recommend, and would rent again if it weren't so memorable.\n"}

Cons: the zipper on the side shows through the mesh cut out, and is a little stuff when bending, so it poked out if you bend to the side.

My BF said that not only were the wedding attendees staring at me, but also the employees of the venue.  I paired this dress with a scoop neck necklace, which really added to it.  It is definitely stretchy and somewhat thin... This is the perfect backup  dress if you're not totally certain about your 1st choice.  I am 5'3 118lbs.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I absolutely loved this dress. From RTR reviews it looked like the dress ran a little large, so I ordered my normal size and a size down, but I ended up wearing my normal size 12. I had a hard time telling from the reviews whether it ran long or not (some people had issues with length, some didn't), so I ordered long since RTR recommended it for anyone 5'7\" or taller (I'm 5'7\"). I tried  it on with heels and sort of felt like it was a little short with heels, so I wore flats and the dress brushed the floor. \n\nThis dress seems to fit curves best, but be prepared for a lot of cleavage -- though, admittedly, it looks worse to you looking down at your chest than it does to everyone else. \n\nIt's a heavy dress, and a little hot, so be prepared for that; I was sweating when I tried it on, and really nervous about wearing it all night in Charleston in June, but it wasn't as hot when I wore it to the wedding as it was when I tried it on. I was comfortable all night. The wedding events were all inside, so that helped; I wouldn't recommend wearing it to an outdoor, warm-weather wedding. \n\nI got tons of compliments and have no regrets!"}

That was the only complaint I had. \nI wore flats with this gown as I am 5'9. The regular length gown was perfect, maybe a little on the long side. "}

I don't know if this would be an issue if I got a bigger size, but I had to take the entire dress off to go to the bathroom. It was so tight around my hips and legs that I couldn't hike it up past my hips. It ended up not being a big deal, I just made some friends in the bathroom to unzip my dress ha.

Some of the comments made me think I should order a size up and I am so glad I didn't. I got tons of compliments on the dress and the color was great.  I am fairly short, so I think this was a good length for me, but when I sat it rode up a lot.  Also, the slip underneath it was the same length as the lace, so when I sat, I had to tuck it into the dress.  Overall, this was an awesome experience and I loved the dress."}

I wore it without a bra (mostly because the back was a little too low, but I think a 10 would have been a bit tighter and therefore higher up on my back). Loved this dress! I got compliments all night from friends and strangers. It's pretty forgiving, I did wear spanx just to smooth out the tummy area, but I was pleasantly surprised with how good it looked. Would totally recommend to someone who wants to hide those few extra cookies. It was also a great length, hitting right above the knee, and I'm fairly tall, so that's difficult to find.

{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "This is my favorite dress I've ever worn in my life, and it was perfect for the spring wedding I attended. I wore a regular bra with a cross-back/racer-back converter for the straps with no problems. Size 6 wasn't available, so I got the 4R and 8R. Thank goodness, because I wouldn't normally have gotten the 4, but it fit very well and the size 8 looked horrible on me in comparison to the 4. I think it's the pattern that makes it look frumpy if it's not form fitting enough. I have a 28\" waist and could breathe and move easily in the 4R. I'm 5'7\" and got the Regular length for low heels (1.5\") - it didn't sweep the floor, and I easily could have worn flats and still not be tripping over it, but it was long enough not to look too awkward. If you're 5'7\" and planning to wear anything taller than 1.5\" heels, get the Long."}

I never felt at risk of wardrobe malfunction, the dress was comfortable the whole night, the fabric was heavy enough to feel conservative even with the tantalizing leg slit, and it was the perfect color to compliment my date's uniform.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "Ended up wearing the 2 instead of the 0 because the fitted bodice caused some unslightly bulge at the armpits.  Wasn't worried about the larger size though because of how structured the dress was; no concern that the neckline would fall."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I wore this dress to a Lady Gaga concert.  The dress was so fun to wear, it was a perfect length and fit.  I wore a size 4 and I was comfortable the entire time.  I dressed it up with aqua colored accessories to bring some extra pop to the dress.  I had my friend tie the back really tight, as I did not wear a bra and wanted to make sire everything stayed put.  The top is really tight so you probably wont be able to wear a bra anyway.  Great dress!!"}
{"fit": "large", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress was actually my third back up option because my original dress was unavailable. This dress looks SO much better in real life especially you have some curves!!\nI attended a black tie event with about 700 women all wearing evening gowns, and I was getting compliments all night long! The lace details is gorgeous, it looks very expensive.\nI am almost 5'8'' AND I was wearing 4 inch heels but there were still few extra inches left at the bottom, it looked amazing. This dress hugs your body and makes your butt and bust look very sexy.\nI am so happy that the other dress didn't work out because this dress was such a success!\nIt's pretty stretchy so I would recommend getting a size down if in doubt."}

I think if I was taller, it might be a bit too short for my figure but it worked great for my petite height. I highly recommend getting the necklace with it as it's a perfect complement - i even ended up getting a manicure to match since the pink complemented the blues and greens in the dress so well! I also love dresses with pockets - will definitely rent again!! "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I usually run between a 4 and a 6, so this fit like a glove and was slightly more snug through the hips.

I pulled it down the entire night (but that is part of the look - Im just not used to wearing this quite so short so I was self conscious about it). The fabric is stiff and a bit thick so would probably be better for a winter or fall wear. "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Absolutely stunning! As soon as I put this gown on, I felt so confident and glamorous. The bold color paired with the cold shoulder look makes statement.  This dress runs true to size, and I suggest sizing down for backup.  I usually wear a size 4, but the size 2 really hugged my curves in all the right places! The dress is fitted throughout, but the stretchy fabric allows room for a fuller bust and hips.  It was about 4 inches too long on me at 5'1\", so I recommend hem tape for fellow petite ladies! You'll be sure to stand out in this gown at your next spring gala or wedding!"}

Such a hot dress for a birthday dinner or date!!!  No Spanx or jewelry or accessories needed - the pattern does the talking. Cons: wetsuit material, heavy fabric and slippery. Might not be good for hot weather. Might require a backless/strapless NuBra so the straps don't show. "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "I ordered the 4 and the 6, since I'm usually between those sizes. They both fit, but I knew I would be dancing at the wedding and wanted to be comfortable.

Although I have a small bust I wore this with a NuBra and there was no issue at all. Accessorizing was so easy because you really only need a colorful pair a shoes and maybe a delicate bracelet. My only issue was that it was very short even tho I am petit I thought It would've been a couple inches toward the knee. Overall highly recommended! I was stopped by everyone at the party to talk about my dress! "}

{"fit": "small", "rating": 3, "review": "Overall, the dress is very cute, but I received two dresses with the same issue!  I originally ordered a size 2 and 4, but the 4 had ripping on the inside seam and bunching along the outside hemline that was very obvious.  Customer support sent me another size 4 overnight, but this one also had bunching along the hemline, though a bit less obvious, and no ripping.  It seems that several of the dresses have this issue the more I look through the reviews.  The size 2 did not have that issue, but unfortunately it was just a  bit too small to zip.  I'm definitely bummed about that issue, but I still got many compliments on the dress!  Also, it also is a bit small in the bust area (my chest is larger than it says on my profile- RTR can't seem to let me change that though), so there was some weird gap at the very top with it being extremely tight directly around my bust.  "}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "The dress was great. It fit well, and was comfortable to wear. I got SO many compliments on how sparkly it was!! It has a flattering vneck what showed the perfect amount of skin. I'm a little self-conscious of my legs, so the fact that the dress hit my knees was perfect! The dress is very flattering, on any body type I could imagine. The only two down points I would give it is that fact that the sequins around the arm holes can irritate your skin a little bit. And, my long hair kept getting stuck on the sequins of the dress. Other that that, it was perfect! "}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 3, "review": "I ordered this dress in a long, but it was still too short so my advice to you tall ladies is to rent a second dress (only $25 more...awesome) just to have a back up.  I say that because I did not order a back up so when I tried it on, although the top was gorgeous and the fit was great, I could not wear it.  I called RTR and spoke to Whitney, who immediately began looking up available dresses, giving me suggestions and helped me choose a new dress, which she had to me by the next day.   The customer service is above and beyond, something that is hard to come by now days.  I would rent again and again just based on that, but their dresses are amazing so that helps:) This was my first RTR experience and it turned me into a devoted client.  Well done, RTR!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 4, "review": "I wore this dress to a wedding where I was the event decorator/coordinator. It was perfect. The slit in the back is high which made me a little self conscious as I was walking. I kept wiggling the dress down. Worked nicely and felt professional!"}

Total power dress!"}

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The length was nearly perfect with heels, and without (because I inevitably danced) it was a tad long but I just hiked the dress up a bit. The slit in the back goes up quite a bit; for me, it was up to the backs of my knees, maybe a bit higher. However, I will say that this added comfort, as it was easy to dance and move around in. The material was stretchy, which is probably why my regular size (2) fit. About the size, my regular size fit, but to size up was much more comfortable and flattering. I think this would depend on your body shape...I got many compliments that night, and the slightly risque back really makes you feel incredible. 10/10!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "Really enjoyed this top and got many compliments. I have a large bust so had to be creative with the outfit. Chose a high-waisted pencil skirt and looked great. The drape of the top makes it not too boxy. The color is really pretty in person and can't wait to rent again."}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "The color is a beautiful orange/coral in person. It really stands out! With the sweetheart neckline under the lace and the keyhole, the dress is still sexy without being overtly so. I was able to wear a regular strapless bra. I had some trouble with the liner staying down, but once I took off my Spanx, I thought the dress actually looked better. The liner is satin-y, so if your event is really hot, I think there is a chance for sweat marks. Once I told my friends that I had rented this dress, they all said I should try to buy it! "}
{"fit": "small", "rating": 3, "review": "Sadly I didn't try this on until the day of the destination wedding we attended. My husband was in the wedding so I was dressing alone and the arms were so tight that I couldn't reach back to zip myself because the zipper was clunky and sticking. I struggled with this for a bit and then ended up wearing something else. The lace laid a little oddly - perhaps it needed to be pressed better because it was longer in the front than the back. I'm sure it's good if you have a friend to zip you up!"}
{"fit": "fit", "rating": 5, "review": "This dress is stunning. I got so many compliments when I wore it to a New Year's party. it hugged my curves beautifully.

{"fit": "fit", "rating": 3, "review": "I saw the combination of the red dress and green jewels and fell in love with the dress online. Everything was wonderful about this dress EXCEPT that the plastic boning is coming out of the bodice, probably from multiple uses/normal wear and tear. I'm sure this could vary dress to dress, but for me it was a very painful experience! I looked great but had puncture wounds when I took the dress off that night.

{"fit": "large", "rating": 4, "review": "Beautiful dress...I received a lot of compliments on it at the event and on social media.  Unfortunately, because I am very short from bust to shoulder, I had to pin it up about 2 inches at the shoulders.  I was able to do so in such a way that was almost undetectable, and I wore my hair down to cover it, but it definitely took away from the excitement and comfort of wearing the dress because I was always aware of it, and didn't want anyone to notice.  Also, even with it pinned up that much, the V was still so deep that I had to tape it because when I sat down it was still WAY too big and was really gaping open.  Even with it taped, it was uncomfortable sitting down because it still gaped open quite a bit.  If there had been a petite available in my possible sizes, I would have tried that and think it may have fit a lot better.  "}

You can tell this is a popular dress; I felt that both sizes I received were still in decent shape, but you can tell they had been \"loved\" - the lace pattern was definitely torn in the sleeve area on the smaller size.  I felt like I was in between sizes.  The 8 was definitely too tight all over; the 10 fit me PERFECTLY from the waist down, but the top was SO baggy.  It looked like there was too much material.  This also made me feel like the dress was too worn - it was like the top of the dress had been stretched out.
